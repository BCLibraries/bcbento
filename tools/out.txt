PressDisplay provides the most recent 60 days of newspapers in 48 languages from 92 countries.See how historical events were reported in the papers as far back as the 17th century. Historical newspapers online include the New York Times(back to 1851); the Times of London (back to 1785); and electronic collections of Early American Newspapers (1690-1876) and several key19th century African-American Newspapers. (Many more historical newspapers are available in harder-to-use but content-rich microform collections.)Get alternative views on a wide range of topics from non-mainstream newspapers via such sources as Ethnic NewsWatch, Alt-PressWatch,GenderWatch, and others.Read translations of articles from non-U.S. newspapers and other news sources in World News Connection.Browse or search ISI Emerging Markets for the text of newspapers, some in English, some in local languages, from developing countries often overlooked in other sources. A few examples: New Vision (Uganda); Kazakhstanskaia Pravda (Kazakhstan); Diario El Mundo (El Salvador); Oslobodjenje (Bosnia-Herzegovina); Thanh Nien News (Vietnam).Search the full text of hundreds of worldwide newspapers at one time via mega-news databases Factiva andLexisNexis Academic.Leaf through paper copies &ndash; yes, they&rsquo;re still around -- of dozens of newspapers in the Current Newspapers section of O&rsquo;Neill Library (near the print stations)."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=610&sid=1294"}

What is ProQuest Digital Microfilm?A. ProQuest Digital Microfilm provides electronic archives from 2008forward for seven newspapers that have previously been archived onmicrofilm in O'Neill Library.  The titles include: the New York Times; Boston Globe; Washington Post;Los Angeles Times; Chicago Tribune; Wall Street Journal; Barron's; andAmerican Banker. Q. Why have the Libraries switched to this digital vesion?A. The online version will be available 24/7, not just when the library is open.  The same item can be viewed by more than one person at a time.  Images can be zoomed, cropped, rotated, and printed much more easily than on film.  They can also be e-mailed and saved, neither of which is possible on film without first converting the film image to digital.Q. Don't we already have these newspapers online in databases like LexisNexis, Factiva, and others?A. Our online newspaper access, with someexceptions, is text only. That is fine for many, if not most, purposes.But some kinds of research look at images, layout, advertisements andother elements that are not viewable in these databases.  We also have no guarantee of perpetual access to these important archival resources in these databases; if we stop subscribing to a database or if a newspaper is dropped from its list we will lose access to the content.  The microfilm -- and the digital microfilm -- is ours forever.Q. What about ProQuest's Historical Newspaper products? Don't they provide the same kind of content?A. The Historical Newspaper products also provide us with online archival access to scanned microfilm images of newspapers, but because of copyright or licensing issues they do not cover recent years.  The Times Historical Newspapers product, for example, does not include the last three years, and the Post, Tribune, and Globe are cut off even further back.  (The Historical Newspapers databases are fully searchable; Digital Microfilm can only be browsed by paper, date, and page.)Q. Why can't we search the content in Digital Microfilm?A. ProQuest has scanned only the images of the newspapers for this product without the OCR (optical character recognition) that would be required for full text searching.  They hope to add links to Digital Microfilm from text-only versions of the newspapers in other databases in the future.Q. I don't see yesterday's or last week's papers in Digital Microfilm.  Why not?A.  ProQuest scans and digitizes the papers in batches and makes them available to subscribers.  There is a gap while each batch is being completed.  (This was also true with microfilm reels.) O'Neill Library has print copies of the most recent issues, and text versions of the articles are available in other databases.  You can also find the most recent 60 days of some of these papers (Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post) in full image in the database PressDisplay.Q. What will happen to the microfilm reels of these newspapers in O'Neill Library?A. Microfilm for older editions of these newspapers will continue to be available in O'Neill Library.  Beginning with 2010 we will no longer receive reels of film for these eight newspapers.  Over time, this will have the added benefit of freeing up space in the library for other resources."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=610&sid=1285203"}

Can the Libraries get a Times digital subscription that we can use?A. No. The Times does not offer multi-user subscriptions for libraries and their patrons. However, through an arrangement with Quality of Student Life Committee (QSLC), Boston College faculty, students and administrators are eligible to receive a 50 percent discount off individual subscriptions via nytimes.com and smartphones.  (Go to NYTimes.com/CollegeDS  and follow the directions there.)Q. Does that mean I can't access any of the Times content on their site or on my smartphone or iPad without an individual subscription?A. The Times allows users to access up to 10 articles on its website per month with no cost. The Top News section will remain free on smartphone and tablet apps. Beyond that, digital subscriptions are required.  Subscribers to the print newspaper get free access via nytimes.com and smartphone and tablet apps.  See the Times digital subscription page for details.Q. Do I have to wait to read Times articles in Factiva and LexisNexis?A. Times articles appear in Factiva and LexisNexis the same day they are published in the paper. Q. Is everything that's available on the nytimes.com site available in the library databases?A. Factiva and LexisNexis provide only the text of Times articles.  Times photos, videos, and multimedia are not available in these databases.  (Photos are included in ProQuest Digital Microfilm, but are not in color or of the same quality as the website.) Online-only articles from the Times website can be searched in Factiva , though they are not included in the browsable contents.Q. What about the print newspaper?  Do the Libraries still carry that?A. Yes.  Print copies of the New York Times are available every day in O'Neill Library, Bapst Library, and the Theology and Ministry Library.  O'Neill keeps print copies for one week.Q. Is this going to happen with other newspapers? If it does, will I have access to content from those papers, too?A. Everyone's going to be watching what happens with the Times, but many think it's inevitable that other newspapers will start charging for content. LexisNexis and Factiva carry many other major (and not so major) newspapers.  The database PressDisplay, available from the BC Libraries, offers the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and many other papers from around the world in full color, exactly as they appear in print, on the same day they are published. The database Massachusetts Newsstand has the Globe and other Massachusetts newspapers.","The New York Times @ BC ******* The New York Times charges for unlimited access to online content on its website and mobile applications.

However, plagiarism in research, taking another&rsquo;s work and passing it off as your own, is quite different. True plagiarism is stealing.Take Excellent NotesPlagiarism often stems from sloppy research and subsequent rewriting rather than a deliberate desire to cheat. Nevertheless, even unintentional failure to cite sources correctly and honestly may constitute plagiarism. Many students mistakenly take bad notes during the research process. They write someone else&rsquo;s text verbatim on a card or on their computer and forget quotation marks. When they write the paper and refer to their notes, they forget the text on the card or computer is another author&rsquo;s and not their own. Any reader who recognizes the original text believes that the student has cheated.

It has no direct physical connection to the person or event being studied. Examples of secondary sources might include: history books, articles in encyclopedias, prints of paintings, replicas of art objects, reviews of research, academic articles. Secondary Sources are sometimes categorized as:Intentional documents, e.g. biographies, memoirs, yearbooks that are composed deliberately to present a record of the past.Unpremeditated documents, e.g. novels, paintings. These are created for a particular immediate purpose, but there is no real intention that they are to be utilized for historical evidence at a later date. For example, Dickens's Little Dorrit is a novel but it might also be useful for gaining insight into aspects of London in the 1850s.It is often difficult to distinguish clearly between primary and secondary sources. Some evidence can be both, at the same time. The first edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica was a secondary source when first published in 1768; but today it is a primary source to historians.

Check with your professor for the preferred bibliography style. It is likely that the requisite style will be that of the Modern Language Association (MLA) or perhaps the Humanities version of The Chicago Manual of Style (BC Libraries have the Manual online). Whichever style you use, it's important that you are consistent; there should be no changes from one documentation system to another within a paper. Online guides for documenting papers include the following:Documentation Styles (The University of Wisconsin-Madison Writing Center)APA TutorialWendy Mages, a doctoral student in the Harvard Graduate School of Education, has put together a very useful tutorial on APA format.

These references can then be inserted into papers and RefWorks will automatically format the footnotes and bibliography in numerous styles including MLA, Turabian and Chicago. As a Web-based product, RefWorks is available to users, both within and without BC's Libraries, from any workstation with an Internet connection.RefWorks also has a utility called Write-N-Cite which allows Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer users to insert cited references directly into their manuscripts with the click of a button. The utility installs a Write-N-Cite icon on your desktop as well as an Add-in to your Word toolbar and a menu option under Tools for launching Write-N-Cite.

(Microfilm) Wilmington, DE: Scholarly Resources, 1998.  Composed of ephemera and serials relating to socioeconomic and political conditions in Latin America from the 1960s through the 1980s, this outstanding microfilm collection from Scholarly Resources is the result of the archival efforts of the North American Congress on Latin America.The collection contains a wide range of documentation, with its principal strength in primary sources such as serials, reports, fliers, pamphlets, posters, manuscripts, and correspondence. The publications generally provide a left-wing ideological perspective covering progressive and human rights issues, but documentation of the political right, the military governments, and the Church is also included.These sources document a history of the activities of various groups, the responses of the government or other authoritative bodies, and the engagement of organizations outside of the country.This material offers a valuable grass-roots perspective on the evolution of the politics of the period and shows the impact that human rights organizations, solidarity groups, guerillas, labor unions, and women -- to name a few --had on the state and political elites. The collection is arranged by country and by subject, then chronologically internally.Consult the GUIDE for detailed contents: Located in O'Neill Microforms Area: Z688.L4 N67ArgentinaBoliviaBrazilCaribbeanCentral AmericaChileColombiaCosta RicaCubaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorGrenadaGuatemalaGuyanaHaitiHondurasJamaicaLatin AmericaMexicoNicaraguaPanamaParaguayPeruPuerto RicoTrinidad & TobagoUruguayVenezuelaRpt.: Americas   Misc.

Each student is responsible for learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting, quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly acknowledged.\"  Refer to BC's comprehensive Academic Integrity Policy.Avoiding plagiarism:Take excellent notes. Plagiarism often stems from sloppy research and subsequent rewriting rather than a deliberate desire to cheat. Nevertheless, even unintentional failure to cite sources correctly and honestly may constitute plagiarism. Many students mistakenly take bad notes during the research process. They write someone else&rsquo;s text verbatim on a card or on their computer and forget quotation marks. When they write the paper and refer to their notes, they forget the text on the card or computer is another author&rsquo;s and not their own. Any reader who recognizes the original text believes that the student has cheated. This can lead to tough penalties. Tips:Take excellent notes, utilize them effectively, write the entire paper yourself, and document sources well and honestly.Ask your professor. If you're not sure about citing something, check with your instructor.Plan your time carefully - often times students make careless mistakes when under pressure to complete a paper or assignment.Further assistance:","Style Manuals ******* "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=954&sid=1797688"}

The language used for the database interface is often a good hint, but when in doubt, try both.  Some databases (MLA International Bibliography, for example) even allow you to browse the thesaurus of specific descriptors used.  Use the database's wildcard symbol(often * or ?) to truncate a search term poet*  retrieves poet, poets, poetry, poetic, poetics ...Use quotation marks to searchfor an exact phrase  For example: \"magic realism\"Use Boolean operators whenallowed AND&ndash; use to combine concepts (when both must be present)OR &ndash;use for synonyms (when either term could be present) NOT &ndash;use for words or phrases to exclude.Use parentheses to group termsExample:(utopia* or distopia*) AND (\"magic realism\" OR fantas* NOT \"science fiction\") ","Google Tips ******* In Google, take advantage of Advanced Search options for more control of your retrieval: Do a simple search first.

This valuation was formally entitled the General Valuation of Rateable Property in Ireland and was carried out by the commissioner of valuation, Richard Griffith. Today, the printed records of this valuation, now almost always known as Griffith's Valuation, are among the most important sources for genealogists researching family histories of the Irish. Referencing more than one million who occupied property in Ireland between 1848 and 1864, the valuation serves as a detailed guide to where in Ireland people lived and what property they possessed. The use of Griffith's as a source has become more widespread since its publication in microfiche format in 1978 by Irish Microforms, Ltd. and since the publication of a surname index to Griffith's in 1963 by the National Library of Ireland. Griffith's Valuation does not list every person who lived in Ireland in the 1840s-1860s.

Many scores are housed on the fourth floor of the O'Neill Library; others are offsite.Scores are arranged by Library of Congress subject headings.

Make sure that you choose a topic that's \"doable\" within the time available. In short, allow enough time to complete your paper. Resources? Are your research sources readily accessible? Traveling,     for example, to the U. of Cal. at Berkeley to study archival material can present time and/or financial problems. Length of Paper? If the instructor mandates 7,500 words, then respect the limit. Not exceeding the limit does not suggest     being wildly under the limit. For a paper with a 7.500 word limit, 2,000     words is unacceptable.Schedule.  Most papers have deadlines. To     meet a deadline, establish a workable schedule. Writing a quality, satisfactorily researched, drafted, revised, and     well written paper takes time! Final Observation. Most instructors do not allow a student to submit     the same paper in two courses. Some may allow students to expand or update an     earlier paper, the product being essentially a new paper. Always discuss this issue with your     instructor. ","Factors Involved ******* Some tips when choosing a topic:Interest.

Content   aside, the writing style and presentation of papers in different educational   fields vary greatly. Nevertheless, certain parts are common to most papers,   for example:Title/Cover Page Contains   the paper's title, the author's name, address, phone number, e-mail, and the day's date.AbstractNot every   education paper requires an abstract.   However, for longer, more complex papers abstracts are particularly   useful. Often only 100 to 300 words, the abstract generally provides a broad   overview and is never more than a page. It describess the essence, the main theme   of the paper. It includes the research question posed, its significance, the   methodology, and the main results or findings. Footnotes or cited works are never listed in an   abstract. Remember to take great care in composing the abstract. It's the first   part of the paper the instructor reads. It must impress with a strong content,   good style, and general aesthetic appeal. Never write it hastily or carelessly.Introduction and Statement       of the ProblemA good introduction states the   main research problem and thesis argument. What precisely are you studying   and why is it important? How original is it? Will it fill a gap in other   studies? Never provide a lengthy justification   for your topic before it has been explicitly stated.Limitations of Study   Indicate as soon as possible what you intend to do, and what you     are not going to attempt. You may limit the scope of your paper by any number of factors, for example, time, personnel, gender, age, geographic location, nationality, and so on.Methodology   Discuss   your research methodology. Did you employ qualitative or quantitative research methods? Did you administer   a questionnaire or interview people? Any field research conducted? How did   you collect data? Did you utilize other libraries or archives? And so on.Literature ReviewThe research process uncovers what other writers have written about   your topic. Your education paper should include a discussion or review of what   is known about the subject and how that knowledge was acquired. Once you provide   the general and specific context of the existing knowledge, then you yourself can build   on others' research. The guide Writing a Literature Review will be helpful here.  Main Body of Paper/Argument This is generally the longest part of the paper. It's where the author supports the thesis and builds the argument. It contains most   of the citations and analysis. This section should focus on a rational   development of the thesis with clear reasoning and solid argumentation at all   points.  A clear focus, avoiding meaningless digressions, provides the essential unity that characterizes a strong education paper.Conclusion    After     spending a great deal of time and energy introducing and arguing the points     in the main body of the paper, the conclusion brings everything together and     underscores what it all means. A stimulating and informative conclusion leaves     the reader informed and well-satisfied. A conclusion that makes sense, when read independently from the rest of the paper, will win praise.Works Cited/BibliographySee the Bibliography section.Appendices Education research papers often contain one or more appendices. An   appendix contains material that is appropriate for enlarging the reader's understanding,   but that does not fit very well into the main body of the paper. Such material   might include tables, charts, summaries, questionnaires, interview questions,   lengthy statistics, maps, pictures, photographs, lists of terms, glossaries,   survey instruments, letters, copies of historical documents, and many other   types of supplementary material. A paper may have several appendices. They are usually placed   after the main body of the paper but before the bibliography or works cited   section. They are usually designated by such headings as Appendix A, Appendix B, and so on. "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=1192&sid=4954"}

Typically, primary sources are contemporary to the events and individuals being researched.Primary sources differ both in content and format from discipline to discipline. Below are examples of primary sources used by:Historians: the book-keeping records of a 1920s small tobacconist; a stone inscription; the handwritten will of a nineteenth century farmer; Abraham Lincoln's ceremonial sword; the hieroglyphics on the temples of Luxor in EgyptPolitical Scientists: the ballot form of the last mayoral race in Boston; the hearings of the 1973 Senate Watergate Committee.Sociologists: the questionnaire used for some surveyLiterary Scholars: original manuscript of Tennyson's poem In MemoriamPhysicists: rock from the moonBiologists: blood samples from a gorillaPsychologists: Notes taken when investigating an individual's post-traumatic stress disorder","Secondary Sources ******* A secondary source is not an original source. It has no direct physical connection to the person or event being studied. Examples of secondary sources might include: history books, articles in encyclopedias, prints of paintings, replicas of art objects, reviews of research, academic articles. Secondary Sources are sometimes categorized as:Intentional documents, e.g. biographies, memoirs, yearbooks that are composed deliberately to present a record of the past.Unpremeditated documents, e.g. novels, paintings. These are created for a particular immediate purpose, but there is no real intention that they are to be utilized for historical evidence at a later date. For example, Dickens's Little Dorrit is a novel but it might also be useful for gaining insight into aspects of London in the 1850s.It is often difficult to distinguish clearly between primary and secondary sources. Some evidence can be both, at the same time. The first edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica was a secondary source when first published in 1768; but today it is a primary source to historians.

Each student is responsible for learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting, quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly acknowledged.\"  Refer to BC's comprehensive Academic Integrity Policy. ","Plagiarism: How to Avoid It ******* Avoiding plagiarism:Take excellent notes. Plagiarism often stems from sloppy research and subsequent rewriting rather than a deliberate desire to cheat. Nevertheless, even unintentional failure to cite sources correctly and honestly may constitute plagiarism. Many students mistakenly take bad notes during the research process. They write someone else&rsquo;s text verbatim on a card or on their computer and forget quotation marks. When they write the paper and refer to their notes, they forget the text on the card or computer is another author&rsquo;s and not their own. Any reader who recognizes the original text believes that the student has cheated. This can lead to tough penalties. Tips:Take excellent notes, utilize them effectively, write the entire paper yourself, and document sources well and honestly.Ask your professor. If you're not sure about citing something, check with your instructor.Plan your time carefully - often times students make careless mistakes when under pressure to complete a paper or assignment.Further assistance:"],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=1192&sid=1946147"}

Review ******* There are numerous ways to organize the material in a lit. review. For example, one might organize the selected    readings by different theoretical approachesspecific concepts or issuesdifferent methodologies employedlevel of support or otherwise that they lend to one&rsquo;s own hypothesis/theory. Such methods are generally better    than organizing chronologically or by author. The latter often result    in a boring review or one lacking clarity or direction.It is common to organize one&rsquo;s lit. review thematically. For    example, one might organize a review on standardized testing    in schools according to the following themes    or issues:BackgroundHistory of standardized tests      Different types of standardized tests      Rationale of standardized tests      Role of high stakes tests      Standardized tests and the law    Standardized Tests in PracticeTesting at elementary school      Testing at secondary school      Statistics    Critics and Proponents of Standardized TestsTesting of students with disabilities      Testing of minority students      Testing of students from different social backgrounds      Gender differences in testing      Case for bias      Case against bias      Teachers&rsquo; perspectives      School administrators&rsquo; perspectives      Students&rsquo; perspectives","Categorizing the Lit. ******* When categorizing the writings in the review, the researcher might considerthe methodology employed; the quality of the findings or conclusions; the document&rsquo;s major strengths and  weaknesses; any other pivotal information. He might consider such questions as:  what beliefs are expressed? Is there an ideological stance? What is being described?  Is it comprehensive or narrow? Are the results generalizable? Remember that you are relating other studies to your study. How do the studies in your lit. review relate to your thesis? How are the other studies related to each other?  ","Many Similar Studies? ******* If there are many similar studies, a strategy might be to discuss themost important ones and say that the results were confirmed in many other studies. Still, to include only germane studies,the reviewer must usually examine many."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=1194&sid=4962"}

It&rsquo;s always  worthwhile to lavish care on the actual writing of your literature review.   Some tips: Keep your audience in mind as you write your literature      review. Your writing should be pitched at the level of expected readers. Use      the terminology appropriate to them, i.e. physics terms for physicists; sociology      terms for sociologists. If you are writing for the ordinary reader, avoid      all jargon. Generally, \"plain English\" is the best strategy. It&rsquo;s usually a good idea to keep your paragraphs short. Subheadings should be used to clarify the structure. They break up the material      into more readable units as well as give the reader a place to \"dive in\" if      she doesn't want to read all of the material. It&rsquo;s often a good idea to write the first draft straight through and quickly      &ndash; this can help preserve continuity and give coherence. Once you have text      down on paper (or on a computer) it&rsquo;s often far easier to make needed revisions.    Some common errors include: a failure to focus by going off on tangents; failure to cite essential pertinent studies; failure to maintain a coherent,      logical flow; weak organization; poor language, grammar etc. Use direct quotation      sparingly and judiciously. Paraphrasing      writers' works is often preferable to quoting direct passages.   Be prudent in the number of studies you discuss and cite. Referring to almost everything      on the subject is useless. Don't cite references that you haven't read. A review is NOT a group of linked abstracts, one per paragraph. At the end of the review the reader, captivated by both the style and content,      should be able to declare: &ldquo;This is precisely the study that must be carried      out now to advance the needed research in this field.&rdquo;"],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=1194&sid=86147"}

Scholarly researchers generally choose the latter type in which to publish. What is a Peer-Reviewed Journal?Many academic journals are called peer-reviewed or refereed journals. Articles submitted to this type of journal for publication consideration are evaluated by several reviewers who are expert in the field covered by the article. These then recommend whether or not the article should be published. Thus, such articles having gone through a rigorous review process tend to have more credibility and intellectual prestige. A very informative video is Peer Review in 5 Minutes (created by North Carolina State University) that well encapsulates the peer-review process.CharacteristicsPeer-Reviewed or Scholarly JournalPopular Journal or MagazineLengthUsually long articles focusing on in-depth analysis of topics.

Evaluative criteria often used include those discussed in the other boxes on this page.","Impact Factor ******* A journal&rsquo;s Impact Factor (IF) is often used to judge the quality of a journal. One may use the database Journal Citation Reports (JCR) to assess the IF of roughly 11,000 Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) journals. The IF is the frequency with which articles from a journal published in the past two years have been cited in a particular year. ISI&rsquo;s IF is calculated by dividing the number of current year citations by the total number of articles published in the two previous years. An IF of 2.0 signifies that, on average, the articles published one or two years ago have been cited twice. Caution: one of the major question marks associated with IFs is that only a small number of journals have them, i.e. only those journals indexed by JCR (over 8,000 journals in Science and 2,700 in the Social Sciences).","Google Scholar Metrics ******* Google Scholar Metrics (GSM) allows one to gauge the visibility and influence of recent articles in scholarly journals. Particularly interesting is GSM&rsquo;s listing of the top 100 publications in several languages, ordered by their five-year h-index and h-median metrics. More details. ","Eigenfactor Score and Article Influence Score ******* Like the Impact Factor, the Eigenfactor\u00ae Score and Article Influence\u00ae Score use citation data to assess and track the influence of a journal in relation to other journals. The Eigenfactor Score calculation is based on the number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year, but it also considers which journals have contributed these citations so that highly cited journals will influence the network more than lesser cited journals. The Article Influence determines the average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years after publication.  It is calculated by dividing a journal&rsquo;s Eigenfactor Score by the number of articles in the journal, normalized as a fraction of all articles in all publications.  The mean Article Influence Score is 1.00. A score greater than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has above-average influence. A score less than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has below-average influence.","Publisher ******* A hint about journal quality may be provided by the society, association, organization publishing it.","Editorial Board ******* The scholarly reputation of editorial board members may provide tips about the quality of the journal. However, this strategy is clearly open to strong elements of subjectivity.","Acceptance/Rejection Rates ******* Methods for determining acceptance/rejection rates may differ from journal to journal. Journal X may calculate the acceptance rate based on the number of articles accepted out of all articles submitted. Journal Y may calculate the rate from the number of articles accepted out of the articles sent out for peer review. Another factor is the disciplinary area. A subject area for which few scholars write articles may have a higher acceptance rate than other more popular subject areas. A strategy useful for determining acceptance/rejection rates in some subject areas, e.g business and education, is to consult Cabell&rsquo;s Directories of Publishing Opportunities.","Peer-Reviewed ******* A traditional criterion for evaluating the quality of a journal is to ascertain whether it is peer reviewed (refereed) or not. However, the challenge here is that often there is a very wide range of quality in peer reviewed journals. One may consult the database UlrichsWeb Global Serials Directory to determine if a journal is peer-reviewed.","Where Indexed ******* Where a journal is indexed may give a clue as to its quality. The database UlrichsWeb Global Serials Directory provides detailed indexing information on over 300,000 journals, both academic and popular.","Publication Fees ******* Many open access journals require authors to pay publication fees. This is not necessarily a red flag. Numerous quality OA journals, some very prestigious, have a system of &ldquo;author pays\". A particular problem, however, is the growth of \"fake\" journals whose sole goal is to obtain money from authors. A useful resource for determining some of these spurious journals is Jeffrey Beall's List of Predatory, Open-Access Publishers."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=1199&sid=3542988"}

The guide begins with some points to bear in mind while researching book reviews. In subsequent sections are descriptive lists of the prominent indexes, databases, and free web sites where reviews of general interest books, as well as reviews of books in the broad humanities, social sciences, and general sciences, may be found. Retrospective indexing sources are noteworthy for their coverage of reviews in scholarly humanities and social sciences journals, many of which were omitted from the more general book review indexes. Finally, the guide notes databases which index reviews of books in more specific subject areas. Any questions or comments may be directed to Lopa Williams at lopa.williams@bc.edu; or at 617-552-4468.","Getting Started *******  Book reviews may be found    in a number of places depending upon the subject matter of the book. Reviews    of books for the general reader, or popular books, may be found in sources which    index general interest periodicals, while reviews of books written on specific    subjects may be found in sources which index more scholarly, or academic, publications.It is useful when looking for book reviews to know:      The author's full name.The book's complete title.The publication year of the book. As reviews of books do not always appear in same year as the books' publication,      it is frequently necessary to consult index volumes for two or more years      following the publication date. Remember also that the great majority of books      never get reviewed at all. Sometimes a new edition of a book will receive reviews, especially if it      is a lengthy period between editions.It is generally useful to consult several reviews of a book to make a      more balanced evaluation. It is of utmost importance that you choose appropriately the index(es)      for finding the reviews. For example, it probably would not be very useful      to seek a review of a book about Renaissance art in an index to medical journals      or a review of a book about Apple computers in an index to nineteenth century      periodicals. Remember that by no means are all periodical indexes in electronic format. In O'Neill Library there are many printed indexes to the periodical literature of a large number of different      disciplines/subject areas. (Most of these printed indexes are in the Index Area on the 1st floor of the O'Neill Library.) Many of these indexes contain citations      to book reviews. It is important that you yourself know as much possible about the book before      you attempt to seek a review. For example, is it a current or historic work?      Is it a popular title or is it more scholarly? Good prior knowledge of the      type of book it is will help you to choose the most appropriate printed index      or electronic resource when you want a review."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=1367&sid=6065"}

Professional terminology can be quite different from the terms we use in everyday English. For example, let's say you're interested in life on other planets. If you were to try \"life\" and \"planets\" in Holmes or a database, your results might be disappointing. If you were to try \"extraterrestrial life,\" you might get further, but still see a dauntingly wide variety of sources to sort through. If you were to confer with experts, you might find that the subject has several branches: Are you interested in finding evidence of intelligent life? Then you'd want to know about SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Are you interested in finding evidence of simple life forms by examining meteorites or Mars Rover samples? Then you'd want to know about astrobiology or exobiology. How can I confer with experts? Subject Encyclopedias. Where do I find them? Here are two strategies:Plan A:Decide what industry, field, or category principally engages with one element of the information you need to find out about. For instance, for extraterrestrial life, you might need either astronomy or biology.From the Libraries Homepage select the Research Guides link. Choose a Research Guide that lists resources for that field. Look for a \"Background Information\" tab. That's where subject encyclopedias are usually listed.  If a title is hyperlinked, that means it's an online resource. If it isn't, it's print resource in the library. NOTE: Some publishers use \"encyclopedia\" and \"dictionary\" interchangeably; in this case, a \"dictionary\" might have long entries like an encyclopedia.Plan B:If you couldn't find an encylopedia or dictionary in the Research Guide for your field:In Holmes  in the first Keyword Search box, type a word that represents the field (e.g. \"engineering\" or \"sports\")In the second keyword search box, type \"encyclopedia.\" Click \"search.\" Note down 2 titles and their call numbers and locations. If a resource is available online, go ahead and click on \"Available Onlilne\" and then click on \"connect to this resource.\"Example TitlesDictionary of Astronomy, 2nd Ed.

Try variations on key words from your topic until you begin to get results that look relevant. Click on a relevant entry and skim it. As you skim, look for:key technical terms related to your topicacronymsmajor conceptsnames of major researchersIn short, you'll be looking for words you can use in your searches--the words of experts.Note the following features about information found in subject-specific encyclopedias:Experts write the articles and are often identified as the authors.The articles often explain technical terms.There is likely to be a bibliography at the end of the article. The bibliography will consist of a list of books and articles that the expert author recommends as centrally important. Use this list as a research tool.Articles in subject encyclopedias do not tend to break new ground themselves; they merely summarize and report on major trends, debates, and ideas in a research area.  If your assignment focuses on finding new research (such as a literature review), encyclopedias are a good resource for background information only, not a source.Additionally, background information may be found in introductions to books, textbooks, Wikipedia, or even your own class notes! Check with your instructor about what constitutes background information, and when it is necessary to cite these resources as sources."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=2075&sid=10140"}

Look under Databases by Subject. Click on the subject you are interested in and you will see a list of resources. Databases of journal articles are listed as \"Articles.\" You may also use the Research Guides link on the libraries homepage. Most research guides have tabs called \"Find Articles\" that list the databases useful for that subject area.For your FWS projects you may find multidisciplinary databases more useful, especially if your research topic spans several fields, or if you are unsure of the fields involved in your query:Multidisciplinary DatabasesAcademic OneFileCQ ResearcherJSTORNewspaper DatabasesLexisNexis AcademicNew York Times 1851-2004 - ProQuest Historical NewspapersGeneral Reference and BackgroundFacts on File","Use the Power of a Database: Subject Terms ******* Using the Power of a DatabaseDatabases are organized information. Google accesses totally unorganized information. If you try to use a database the way you use Google, you'll miss the major advantage of a database. Subject Terms are the key to unlocking the power of a database. Here's how it works in Academic OneFile:Go to Academic OneFile, and click on Subject Guide Search. You should arrive here:In the search bar type blogs and hit the search button.How many records? (That's how many articles in the database would be returned by that subject term in a search.) Do you have time to skim nearly 20,000 articles in the next week to find relevant articles? No? You can use Subdivisions and Related Terms to see terms that are more narrowly focused on your topic.First, click on Subdivisions. This answers the question, \"What about blogs?\"When you click on a subdivision, you will get the entire list of articles in the database organized by that subdivision: e.g., if you click on Analysis, you will get a list of 279 articles about the analysis of blogs. You probably don't have time to skim 279 articles, though. On the results screen, you will be able to further narrow the results with limiters in the left-hand column, such as article type (e.g., peer-reviewed), other subject terms, date ranges, and more.If you didn't find a relevant subdivision, go back to the prior page and click on Related Subjects: perhaps your topic is better described by a heading here. Note the second column, where it shows where each term fits in the hierarchy of subjects in relation to \"blogs.\"","Default Setting: Keyword Search ******* No relevant subject subdivision? Click on the Advanced Search option on the top menu to do a keyword search.For example, let's say you want to know how blogs are used in elections and politics. You could put \"blogs\" in the first line and use the drop-down menu to select \"subject\" (since you already know it's a subject term), and then add \"politics\" in the second line. But wait! What if you want to search \"political\" and \"politician\" at the same time? Then you need the magic asterisk. If you type \"politic*\", the database will search all words that begin with that string of letters, including \"politics,\" \"political,\" \"politician,\" etc.Keyword Search: The database looks for the keyword in every field about an article except its full text. The word in the search bar might appear in the journal title, the article title, the abstract, the subject terms... even the author. In other words, a keyword search only returns rough approximations of relevance.","Time-Saving Features ******* When you click on an article title, you'll go to the article record page, NOT the article itself. Here, you can find out a little more about the article in the Abstract, a brief summary of the article's major points. There are also some useful time-saving tools to the right:You can:print the article record (not the article, from here) to a networked printer,email it to yourself,upload the citation directly to RefWorks by clicking on Citation Tools,save a bookmark to your personal Academic OneFile folder (if you're logged in), orshare the citation with nearly a dozen social networking sites.If the article is full-text within this database, there will either be a pdf link somewhere on the page, or (if it's full-text html), the article will be below the abstract and publication information.","No Article Link? Don't Worry! ******* If you don't see a pdf link or the article, don't worry; you still have access. Just click on the button. You will go either straight to the article or to a page in Holmes. If you go to Holmes, there are two possible results: either the article is available by clicking a link, or the article is available by requesting it through interlibrary loan.

Usually names of people, but sometimes names of organizations or companies. An \"author\" is whatever or whoever claims \"authority\" (in the sense of responsibility) for the work.Title of the work. This could be a title of an article, a book, a web-page, a TV show, a film...Title of the larger work of which this work is a part: a periodical (for an article), a book (for a separately written chapter, introduction, or article), a website (for a web-page), etc.Year of Publication.Other date-like information: Volume and issue (for a journal), Month and date (for a magazine or newspaper)Publisher (for book or website)Place of publication (for book)The order, punctuation, and formatting depend on the citation style. Why isn't there just one single, standard citation style? Tradition. Tradition, and some pretty good reasons. For example, in the sciences, the date of publication really matters, because the results of newer studies often change or negate conclusions of older studies. Therefore, in American Psychological Assocation (APA) style, in-text citations use author and year, like this: (Jones, 2008), and in the works cited, publication year is prominent:Jones, RA. (2008). Neurological and behavioral effects of intrusion evidence on post-hibernating juvenile and adult ursus americanus. American Natural History, 28(3), 58-73.In contrast, publication date has little to do with an work's authority in the study of literature. How could it, when many literary critics still refer to Aristotle's Poetics, published over 2,000 years ago? More important in literature studies is the exact location of a quote in a literary work. Modern Language Association (MLA) style, therefore, dictates the use of author, page # for in-text citations: (Jones 48). The works cited list also de-emphasizes publication dates:Jones, Richard A. \"Goldilocks Unmoored: Cross-cultural Re-readings of Intrusion and The Other.\" Signs, Signifiers, and Signifieds, 29.2 (2001): 34-56.Online ResourcesCitation help on the BC Libraries websiteMLA and APA style guides on the Purdue OWL websiteChicago Manual of Style Online: DocumentationPrint Citation Guides/Style ManualsYou may have a citation situation that doesn't seem to fit any of the models of citations or works cited in one an online guide.

Each student is responsible for learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting, quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly acknowledged.","Why is Plagiarism So Bad? ******* Plagiarism is StealingEvery day we take ideas from others without acknowledging the original source. When you slip, \"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't,\" into a conversation, you wouldn't add, \"Shakespeare's Hamlet, Act II, Scene 2, Polonius.\" Why not? Because that kind of quoting is an allusion, and the pleasure of an allusion is the \"secret\" knowledge of the source that distinguishes you and your audience from the people not in on the allusion. We also don't tend to share sources of jokes, gossip, or brilliant analyses of last night's hockey win for similar reasons: we want to claim a little glory for ourselves.However, using sources in research is different. Why? For one thing, more is riding on it than your short-lived reputation as a literary master or sports commentator; your writing is consequential. For another thing, the professional academic culture, of which you are an apprentice, is based on a system that depends wholly on ethical crediting of sources. Professors' careers are made or broken on the strength of their research and the degree to which their colleagues cite them. The more citations, the higher the reputation. The higher the reputation, the better chance of grants, awards, and tenure. Scholars use each other's ideas constantly: this is how knowledge advances. Using scholarly information incurs one simple cost: crediting the source. That's it. You don't need to pay a professor in cash to use her ideas; all you need to do is credit her. With that credit, she builds a reputation and a career. Without it, her Ph.D. is just an expensive piece of paper.So, when you take another person's ideas and pass them off as your own, you are undermining a sacrosanct pillar of academia: the free (but documented!) exchange of information. When you plagiarize, you are telling your professor, in essence, \"You and everything you do are worthless junk, hardly more consequential than a joke or piece of gossip.\" Not surprisingly, instructors take plagiarism seriously. It can lead to tough penalties; depending on the seriousness, penalties can range from a warning, to a reduced grade, failure in the course, or academic probation, suspension, or expulsion.","It Starts in Your Notes ******* Plagiarism often stems from sloppy research and subsequent rewriting rather than a deliberate desire to cheat. Nevertheless, even unintentional failure to cite sources correctly and honestly may constitute plagiarism. Many students mistakenly take bad notes during the research process. They write someone else&rsquo;s text verbatim on a card or on their computer without quotation marks. When they write the paper and refer to their notes, they forget the text on the card or computer is another author&rsquo;s and not their own. Any reader who recognizes the original text believes that the student has cheated.Take clear notes. If this means using a lot of paper or a lot of computer files, so be it.Use symbols in your notes (quotations marks, lines, boxes...) to clearly separate others words or ideas from your own.Use symbols to distinguish verbatim quotation from summary or paraphrase.Check your summaries and paraphrases against original language: make sure identical phrases are in quotation marks.Keep clear records of sources on note cards, in a notebook, in a word processor file, or using a citation manager like RefWorks, EndNote or Zotero.A final note: many of you will be tempted to write a research paper in one big step, with a word processor and many source documents open at once. That method is a near guarantee of accidental plagiarism: it's 2:00am, you've had 5 cups of coffee, you copy and paste a great quote from one of 8 source documents into your paper, close the tab, and you get a text message you have to answer... wait... where did that quote come from? This problem started over a week ago, when you didn't start the paper ahead of time. Rushing will create mistakes.","Useful Sites ******* Purdue University OWL \"Avoiding Plagiarism\"Plagiarism: What It is and How to Recognize and Avoid ItBC's Academic Integrity Policies","Other Ethical Considerations ******* Plagiarism is just one of many potential ethical transgressions involved in writing; it just happens to be the one that matters most in scholarly writing. It is also unethical to invent quotations, or to selectively quote a source in a way that misrepresents the source's meaning. Here is a useful rubric for evaluating the ethical & productive use of source material (PDF).In other contexts, other ethical considerations take precedence. Here are just a few examples of ethical breaches in various fields:Journalism: Misquoting a source, or worse, inventing a quote. Journalists' careers have ended over invented quotes or events.Medicine and clinical psychology: Breaches of confidentiality; ambiguously-worded or poorly kept records that lead to bad patient outcomes.Law: Failing to diligently research factual and legal background for a case; failing to file documents on time with the clerk of courts.Finance: Giving \"insider\" advice to investors.In other words, whenever your writing is consequential, you have an ethical obligation to consider all of the possible consequences of your writing for other people."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=2075&sid=10178"}

Is the information now out of date? In some cases (for example, medical research) people often want material as up-to-date as possible. Often in the humanities, both old and up-to-date information may be useful.In books, the date of publication is on the page immediately after the title page; sometimes, there are multiple dates. The most recent date is the date of publication. In articles, the date of publication is easiest to find in the bibliographic information in the database in which you found it. Often, it is also in header or footer information on the first page of the article, or on a \"rights\" page immediately after the last page of the article. Web pages are tricky; if there is no date at the bottom of the page (usually with a copyright symbol \u00a9), consider the possibility that the source is unreliable. Look around on the page for an \"updated\" date, too, but often, that copyright date is all you have.Edition or RevisionIf your source is a book, what edition are you looking at? (If there is an edition, it will be displayed prominently on the cover.) Books that have other editions indicate that the information has been frequently updated. If there is a newer edition, try to get that one; older editions may include obsolete information. PublisherUniversity press books are likely to be scholarly. A publisher's reputation may not always guarantee an excellent publication, but prestigious publishers are more likely to pay attention to quality.For articles, the \"publisher\" equivalent is the journal title. If you are wondering what type of periodical your source article is in, see Type of Journal, Magazine, or Newspaper. If you want to evaluate the quality of a scholarly journal Google Scholar provides an interesting tool that ranks journals according to how often articles in them are cited by other articles. Just type in the journal's name and hit search. (If it has no record, it does not mean the journal is low quality; it just means Google Scholar hasn't ranked it.)

But how can you tell if an article listing in a database is from a popular periodical?Identifying FeaturesThe article title is catchy and short, designed for broad appeal.The title of the magazine may be familiar to you.Articles open with an appealing sentence that begins a story.Publication is on a short cycle, usually daily, weekly, or monthly.No abstract (or a very brief abstract) is provided.Visuals are designed for appeal.Snapshot in the WildSample Popular TitlesBusiness WeekEbonyReaders DigestSports IllustratedWhat \"Popular\" MeansArticles:balance information with entertainment: information is embedded in a story.sometimes cite experts, but in a very general way (\"Scientists say...\") or by naming a person and his/her employer (\"According to Jane Smith, a researcher at Harvard Medical school\").are fact-checked to varying degrees by editorial departments; thoroughness depends on the periodical.focus on events, personalities, hobbies, breaking news stories, or explanations of new research of general interest.are expected to help sell issues of the periodical. Accuracy is often sacrificed to readability and appeal.Why Use Articles from Popular SourcesTo familiarize yourself with background on a topic before delving into research.To understand the broad appeal of or conventional perspectives on a topic.To find potential sources: look for names of researchers (e.g. Jane Smith) to use for author searches in academic journals.To establish a research need in your introduction, by providing evidence for broad interest in a topic.To get information (currently breaking news, investigative reporting, etc.) not available in other source types.Sub-Types of Popular PeriodicalsTabloidsTabloid periodicals come in a variety of styles, but often use a newspaper format. Their language is elementary and occasionally inflammatory or sensational. They assume a certain gullibility in their audience. Tabloids appeal to curiosity, satisfy appetites for gossip and sex, and cater to popular superstitions. They often do so with flashy headlines designed to astonish (e.g. Aliens from Mars Invade Michael Jackson's Mansion) or photos of celebrities.Sample Tabloid TitlesNational ExaminerStarSunWeekly World NewsSubstantive News or General InterestSubstantive news or general interest sources are usually attractive in appearance, and may include photographs. Some, though not very many, may cite sources. Authors of articles appearing in this type of publication include editorial staff, scholars, and freelance writers. They are generally published far more frequently than scholarly journals. Editorial departments in these periodicals do a more thorough job of fact-checking than other popular periodicals (and issue retractions when published stories have erred) and work diligently to avoid bias.Sample Substantive News or General Interest PeriodicalsThe New YorkerNational GeographicScientific AmericanThe Wall Street Journal","The Categories, Briefly ******* PopularProvide information and entertainment to segments of the publicMost of the periodicals you have encountered in life--magazines and newspapers available at the grocery store, airport kiosks, and convenience stores--are categorized as \"popular\" periodicals. That is, they have wide readerships, usually are (or are part of) for-profit businesses whose purpose is to increase circulation and sell advertising space, and they cover ideas, issues, events, personalities, and activities that have popular appeal.Scholarly/AcademicProvide well-sourced, technical information to researchers and expert practitionersPhysical Review and Nature Geoscience won't be making appearances at your local grocery checkout aisle. Journals like these, with circulations of two to four thousand, clearly aren't focused on wide appeal. They provide platforms for scholars to share research results that are often arcane and difficult to read for outsiders, and yet together form the foundation of substantive human knowledge about everything from abstract mathematics to zoology.Trade/IndustryProvide practical business and industry news and information to workplace professionalsYou probably haven't ever run across Global Cosmetic Industry or Ink Technologies at an airport kiosk. That's because they have very narrow appeal, targeting particular industries.  They provide news about new products and processes, conferences and trade shows, and companies. Sometimes these are the only source of information about recent developments in business and industry.","Trade/Industry ******* Identifying FeaturesThe article title (in plain English) names businesses, products, or personalities of limited general interest.The journal title indicates industry or business focus.There is no abstract or only a brief abstract.The article begins like a newspaper or magazine story, and is often formatted like one.The article usually names an executive, a business, or a product within the first few lines.There are often colorful photos, diagrams, graphs and charts.Snapshot in the WildSample TitlesADWeekWindpower MonthlyAccounting TodayInvestor's Business DailyWhat \"Trade/Industry\" MeansArticles:are focused on a particular industry's concerns.are written either by an industry practitioner or a journalist with experience in the industry.are often published by an industry's professional association.often cover developments covered nowhere else.Why use Trade/Industry Journals?To understand practical, business perspectives on a concept (e.g., how research is applied).To get industry-insider information not available in general news sources.To learn background information on a topic in less technical language than is found in academic journals.To get breaking stories on recent product developments (esp. B2B-oriented products).To understand broad trends in markets and industries."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=2075&sid=12716"}

A great way to start with flexibility: begin with a question:Do computers threaten our privacy?Note that the question has two main components in a relationship with each other: computers and privacy. That's important.2Main conceptsIdentify main concepts and keywords--computers and privacy. If you had asked \"What threatens our privacy?\" there would have been only one identifiable component: privacy. You'll see shortly why 2 is a magic number.3SynonymsCreate a word list of synonyms and variations on the keywords that may be used to search the question. (The list below is far from exhaustive. I'm sure you can do better.)    ComputersPrivacyInternetConfidentialityWorld Wide WebCivil Liberties 4Background InformationWhich academic discipline concerns itself with your topic? On the main LibGuides@BC page, find the main in-depth page for that academic discipline. On that page, use the Background Information tab to locate a subject encyclopedia or dictionary. Use your search terms and synonyms to find background information on your topic. Familiarize yourself with major terms, names of theorists and researchers, a history of the topic, and major theories and concepts. Then add some more synonyms to your synonym list: the words that scholars use to talk about your topic.5AND, BUT and OR Open Holmes or any journal database.Given an option, always pick \"Advanced Searching.\" With advanced searching, you get more than one search bar. It's not to make life complicated: it's to make your searches more successful. That single search bar is a simple interface, yes. But how simple is it to wade through the hundreds thousands millions of irrelevant entries you usually get?Having multiple search bars means you can specify really clearly how you want the database (or Holmes) to search.Try it yourself.  Type \"computers\" in the first box, and click \"Search.\" Look for the number of records. It's big, right? Now go back to that search page, and type \"computers\" in the first box and \"privacy\" in the second box and click \"Search.\" How many results now? Go back to the search page. With \"computers\" and \"privacy\" in the first two boxes, change the first \"And\" to \"Or.\" Click \"Search.\" Now what happened? Bigger than the first number, right?You have just experienced the magic of Boolean Operators (And, But, Or). And you know why 2 is the magic number.When you link two terms with \"And,\" the search will return every record that contains BOTH search terms: this narrows the search.When you link two terms with \"Or,\" the search will return every record that contains EITHER search term: this broadens the search.When you link two terms with \"Not,\" the search will return every record that contains the first search term, but NOT the second term: this narrows the search, too.Try it yourself: Now do the same thing with your own search terms. Write down the number of search results with each term, pair of terms, and combination with Boolean Operators. (e.g.: Term 1:____, Term 1, AND Term 2:____, Term 1 OR Term 2___, Term 1 NOT Term 2____)6Changing the TermsThis is when we'll finally employ your synonyms. Every database (and Holmes is technically a database, fyi) has something google doesn't: brains. Human brains. Google returns results based on a complex set of algorithms--in other words, instructions--that search entire websites, and lets you sort the few useful pieces out of the mountains of junk. Why? The internet is disorganized. All search engines can do is find all the instances of a word and then attempt to rank results.Databases, on the other hand, are organized. That is, human beings have created a layer of information about the articles. That layer is called \"metadata\" (data about data). Imagine looking for a funny joke on the internet. You type \"funny joke\" in the search bar, but your search engine only searches full text, without that layer of metadata. Have you ever heard a comedian say, \"Here's a really funny joke\" and then tell the joke? That's the thing about full-text searching: the phrase \"funny joke\" isn't in the text; it's only in the metadata. Database searches are based on metadata, not full text. The trick is in figuring out the terms of a database's metadata. If funny articles are categorized as \"humor,\" the search term \"funny\" will return close to nothing.Try it yourself: Use a pair of your own synonyms and repeat the last \"Try it yourself\" exercise. This time, scan down the first dozen or so results for each search. Judging by titles, what proportion of titles seem relevant? Try another pair of synonyms, and watch the results again. Which pair of terms returned the best results? (Best = Highest number plus best proportion of relevant results.)7Changing the Research QuestionRemember flexibility? Here's a quick rule-of-thumb about search results in databases for single-word searches: Above 10,000 and a good proportion of relevance = good term, good database; go ahead and start combining terms with that term in that database. Below 1,000 = wrong term or wrong database. Try a synonym. If 5 synonyms don't work, try a different database. If that doesn't work, you need to change the terms of your research question. Don't give up on this question! Just change the terms. You might need to do some background research in order to learn key terms in the field, as opposed to the lay terms you're using. You may even find out your topic needs a little adjustment.Another trick for figuring out useful search terms takes advantage of a database's subject terms, which is covered in Finding Articles.

There are several ways to combine terms, each with very different results. First, it helps to know how a database is arranged. Each record in a database has a number of different clumps of information, called \"fields\" : the article title, the author, the abstract (summary),  etc. This set of fields is called \"metadata\": that is, information about the publication. When you enter a search term, the default search looks for the term in all of those fields, and when the database finds the term, it adds that record to the search results. It is important to remember that most databases do not search the full text of articles: they search the metadata fields.When you use two terms, what happens? It depends on how those two terms are joined with AND, OR, and NOT. You are familiar with how these words are used in speech and writing, but when you use them in database searches, they're called Boolean Operators, and they function differently.","Boolean operator: AND ******* When you use AND and two keywords, the interface will return a list of every record that contains both the first term AND the second term. This kind of search will always reduce the number of records.Most databases are set to use AND as the default connector, because it is the most commonly used one. Keep in mind: your search results will not necessarily include the phrase \"internet privacy\": it will just include all the records that have both terms in their metadata.If you combine too many terms with AND, you may return no records at all, because one or more terms might not overlap with anything else. ","Boolean operator: OR ******* When you use OR and two keywords, the interface will return a list of every record that contains either the first term OR the second term. This kind of search will always increase the number of records.If you combine too many terms (or a few terms that are too broad) with OR, you will return an unmanageable number of records.OR is usually used when there are multiple synonyms, and you don't want to accidentally limit your search: e.g.,  students OR pupils OR schoolchildren.","Boolean operator: NOT ******* When you use NOT and two keywords, the interface will return a list of every record that contains the first term, but exclude any record with the second term. This kind of search will always reduce the number of records.  NOT is usually used in conjunction with an AND search, to exclude records that are unrelated to your goals but cluttering the search results, e.g.: internet AND privacy NOT security. ","Other Search Hints ******* Parentheses ( )In most databases, you can construct more complex searches by using parentheses. If you want to search internet AND privacy, but want to add some synonyms to the search and don't want results about security:(internet OR web) AND (privacy OR rights) NOT securityAsterisk *If your search involves words like \"children\" or \"pupils\", you don't want to accidentally rule out records with words like \"child\" or \"pupil\". To save you the trouble of using OR in these cases, most databases let you use an asterisk in place of a word ending:child* OR pupil*This search will return results with child, children, pupil, or pupils. Be careful, though; it could also return \"childcare.\" Some databases now automatically return results with different endings, or even return results with endings removed. You'll probably be able to tell in the search results.Search inMost databases let you choose which field or fields you want to search in. The default is usually \"any field,\" which is also called a \"keyword\" search. This searches all of the fields of metadata. You could specify title, subject, author name, journal title, publisher, or any number of other fields depending on the database. This can be quite useful if you want to combine, say, a subject term with a keyword. It can also be handy if you have the bibliographic information, and just need the full text of the article: just do an AND search with Author selected in the first line and Title in the second. Usually, an author's last name and a distinctive word or phrase from the title will suffice."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=2075&sid=3294262"}

Simply click on that link, and you will be able to download the dissertation. Please note: Dissertations are very long, often 150 pages or more.

Some of the most commonly used types are summarized below. Click on a name to go to a sub-tab with more detailed information about that box type.Rich Text/Dynamic Content/ Scripts:Rich Text/Dynamic Content/Scripts is the most versatile box type, for any type of formatted text (including html), links, or dynamic javascript code.Links & Lists:The Links & Lists box type enables you to mix web links with non-web link items. Each item can have a short description which appears underneath the item, and an optional More Info button which the user can click on to get more information.Simple Web Links:Simple Web Links boxes can include a short description which appears when the cursor hovers over the link.RSS Feed:The RSS Feed box type enables you to dynamically display the contents of an RSS feed on your page.Embedded Media & Widgets:An embedded media box enables you to embed streaming video or audio or a widget inside your page. Videos can reside on any video sharing sites (YouTube and the like...). You need to enter the full embed code to embed it inside the content box.Other Content Boxes:Follow this link for info on other kinds of boxes.","One, Two, or Three Columns? ******* The default format for a LibGuides page consists of a narrow column on the left, a wide column in the center, and a narrow column with the librarian's profile box on the right.The format can be changed to have one, two, or three columns with adjustable widths. Here's how to change from the default:Click on Add/Edit Pages on the yellow command bar.Select Resize ColumnsChange the number and/or width of columns by following the instructions on the screen.","Reusing & Reordering Boxes ******* Reusing content boxes:When adding a new content box, instead of creating a new box you can reuse existing boxes in two different ways.

You can also move boxes between columns. You can even move boxes from one page to any other page within the same guide.To reorder boxes:Click on Add/Edit Pages on the yellow command bar.Select Reorder Boxes.Drag and drop the boxes you want to move to the desired locations.Click on Update Box Order","Design Tip ******* Two columns (in addition to the column with your profile box) are better than one for multiple boxes. If you have more than one content box on a page, using two columns will make apparent, without scrolling, more of what the page offers.  Some content boxes -- ones with large images, for example -- won't work in the left column.

Make it easier to manage and edit content, with each element (title, URL, description) of each link able to be edited via a form instead of having to move through a long block of text to make changes.Allow tracking of linked resources, showing how often each link in each box has been clicked on.Allow for global URL changes, making it possible to change all instances of a resource's URL (if necessary) in one step, instead of one at a time.Encourage concise descriptions. Thereare limits on the length of descriptions, but shorter descriptions aregenerally better and in keeping with our goal of less text-heavyguides.

The links appear in a bulleted list with the descriptions beneath the names and, if there is additional information, an icon  that you click on to bring up that information.Links can also be included in text boxes.This page describes the advantages of link boxes, differences between the two types of link boxes, and possible reasons you might want to put links in a text box.","2 Possible Reasons to List Links in Text Boxes ******* There are two possible disadvantages and reasons you might want to keep links in a text box:Size limit on descriptions:A Simple Web Links box gives you only 255 characters for descriptions.A Links & Lists box gives you that and an additional pop-up description unlimited in size. There may be cases where you feel it's necessary to provide a longer description without a pop-up. In general, though, shorter is better; thelonger the text, the less likely our users are to read it. Inability to group links in a box:There may be cases where you'll want to group Web links by somecategory. You cannot do this in a single box (though you can createseparate boxes on a page for different types of links.)

Subjects covered include significant Muslim figures, tribes, dynasties, crafts and sciences, political and religious institutions, geography,ethnography, flora and fauna of the various countries, and the history,topography and monuments of the major towns and cities.

Search for allah will match All\u0101h.Numbers: Key in \"1:1\" in the search field, including the double quotes to find 1:1.Phrases: Include a phrase in double quotes, eg \"arabic script\" to retrieve all articles that contain the exact phrase.Wildcards: You can use the \"?\" symbol to perform a single character wildcard search; or you can use the \"*\" symbol for zero or more characters.For example, jo? will match job and joy. The term jo* will also match jonah, john and journey.Fuzzy searches (pattern matches): A fuzzy search is useful if you are not sure how to spell a particular word, or if alternative spellings are permissible. To perform a fuzzy search, simply add the \"~\" character to the end of the search term. For example, grammer~ will match grammar.Proximity searches: Use the \"~\" character plus a number at the end of a phrase. For example, the query \"adam eve\"~3 will match the two terms within 3 words of each other.Boolean operators: AND, OR and NOT are allowed Boolean operators, all of which must be typed in upper case.    For example: the search string adam AND eve will find all articles containing the words Adam and Eve.","Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics ******* The Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics (EALL Online)  (BC Community Only) comprehensively covers all aspects of Arabic languages and linguistics.

Although there are legal distinctions among nonprofit organizations and different reporting requirements, all are exempt from paying federal income taxes. About half of nonprofits - called charitable organizations - are exempt under Section 501(c)(3). This status permits donations to charities to be tax-deductible to the donor.","Types of Tax Exempt Organizations ******* What is 501(c)(3)? Section of the Internal Revenue Code that designates an organization as charitable and tax-exempt. Organizations qualifying under this section include religious, educational, charitable, amateur athletic, scientific or literary groups, organizations testing for public safety or organizations involved in prevention of cruelty to children or animals. Most organizations seeking foundation or corporate contributions secure a Section 501(c)(3) classification from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Note: The tax code sets forth a list of sections-501(c)(4-26)-to identify other nonprofit organizations whose function is not solely charitable (e.g., professional or veterans organizations, chambers of commerce, fraternal societies, etc.).","Business FAQs ******* Can't find what you are looking for?

Then, type in the year of the older article.  Click the Search button to see a list of candidate entries.

{"guide_id":"34024","tags":{"0":"general_chemistry, ch110, chem_110"},"guide_name":"CH 110 General Chemistry II: Library Resources","guide_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/CH110","page_name":"Begin Your Research","page_id":"256885","taxonomy":[],"page_text":["The Research Process ******* You need to do research on chemistry topics... where to begin?  Here is one approach to the process. 1.  First, find a topic that interests you!  There are lots of ways to do this:browse your textbook or think about the topics that you've already discussed in class; talk with your professor; browse through some of the general chemistry and science journals here at BC to see if something catches your eye.  Take a look at the Science News page in the General Science Resources LibGuides for some good resources to try.2.  Make sure that your topic is not too narrow and not too broad.  You may start off with a great idea, but if you can't find enough information to write your paper, you'll either need to find a new topic or broaden the topic that you already have.  Alternatively, if when you start your research, you're overwhelmed by all that you find that might be related, you should think about studying a sub-topic of your original idea.3.  Next, make sure that you understand the basics of your topic -- what are some of the key terms used in discussing it, how do they relate to each other (broader?, narrower?)  Use the Background Information tab in this guide to find resources that can increase your understanding here.4.  Look in Holmes for books that cover your topic -- books may be broader in scope, and include a chapter on your topic, or they may be focused in detail on your topic.  Look at the Holmes search tips on the Find It at BC page of this guide.  Books (often called \"monographs\") can be a great way of strengthening your understanding of your topic.5.  Most scientific dialogue takes place in journals -- these are, basically, scholarly \"magazines\" published on a regular basis, containing articles written by experts in their fields.  Scholarly journal articles must be reviewed by the author's peers in the field (the \"peer review\" process) before acceptance for publication.  Journal articles are usually more up-to-date and more focused in their content than books.  Journal articles may be reporting on primary research (reporting new experimental results or theory), or they may be a special type: review articles.  It is this second type that you'll find most useful as you are getting underway with research for this class.6.  Look for Review Articles on your topic.  Review articles summarize what is known about a given topic, written by an expert.  These are widely used in the sciences, by both specialists and non-specialists.  These articles are not reporting on original research results, but are surveying the results of many earlier studies.  They are particularly useful for all of the references to earlier important work that they provide.  Use the Find Articles tab to learn about the online databases that can help you locate review articles.7.  Use Online Databases to locate journal articles of all types.  Online databases are electronic resources that index the journals published in a given subject area, helping you find articles on your topic published in any of the large number of science journals published.  Using an online database like Academic OneFile (which covers all disciplines, including a fair number of scholarly science journals) or Web of Science (covering all of the sciences), you'll be able to find scholarly articles by searching for keywords on your topic.  Once you learn more about the topic, you'll get to know the names of some of the major researchers in your area, and you may want to search by author name in a given database, also.  Be sure to see the Web of Science search tips tab to make the most of your searching efforts.Online databases in the sciences provide access to both review articles (see below) and primary journal literature.  The primary literature is where researchers publish their new research results.8.  As you keep searching, you'll be learning more about your topic -- use the new terms and new connections that you uncover to do more searching -- often you will find things that you didn't find the first time through.9.  As you find interesting articles and other references, organize/manage them in your personal database.  RefWorks can be a great way to manage your references so that you can find them when you need them.  Use RefWorks when you're writing your paper to insert footnotes in the text and to create a bibliography when you're done.10.  Finally, just like you need to use APA or MLA styles when writing papers for other courses, chemistry has its own style guidelines.

Copyright issecured automatically when a work is \"fixed in a tangible medium ofexpression.\" This means that the work must exist in some physical form forat least some period of time, no matter how brief. Copyright does not protectideas that are not expressed in tangible form. Written works, photographs, andcomputer files are all examples of tangible media.Do I have to register my work with the Copyright office or include a \u00a9?Registration, publication anda copyright notice are no longer legally required in order to have copyright.There are advantages to giving notice of copyright ownership, however, includingputting others on notice of the author&rsquo;s claim of rights and taking advantageof the availability of certain damages in connection with an infringement claim.  A copyright notice includes the symbol, theauthor&rsquo;s name and the year.Registration alsoprovides several advantages. It establishes a public record of the copyrightclaim, and it is necessary for works of U. S. origin before an infringementsuit may be filed in court.Who owns &ldquo;works for hire&rdquo;?Works for hire are worksprepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment and certainspecially ordered or commissioned works prepared under written agreement.  In the case of works made for hire, theemployer and not the employee is considered to be the author. [See the note onBoston College's Intellectual Property Policy to the left.]How long does a copyright last? In general, the copyrightterm for a work created in the United  States after 1977 (that is not a work madefor hire) is the life of the author plus 70 years. Once the copyright expires,the work passes into the Public Domain.","Intellectual Property ******* Boston College 's Intellectual Property Policy provides that, with some exceptions (includingworks under sponsored projects, works-for-hire, and works created with the useof substantial University resources), faculty members and students retain theircopyright in their own pedagogical or scholarly works, including textbooks,dissertations, theses, papers, and journal articles.

For example, contracts often impede placing the published work on course websitesin a course-packin scholarly presentationson the author&rsquo;s personal web page and in such scholarly e-print repositories as BC's own eScholarship@BC. In fact, after ceding copyright to the publisher, the author generally has little say in how the work is later used. The result, all too often, is that contracts restrict the dissemination of one&rsquo;s scholarship and lessen one&rsquo;s impact as an author. Accordingly, authors should take care to assign the rights to their work in a manner that permits them and their colleagues to use the work freely, both in their teaching and research at BC. Transferring copyright doesn&rsquo;t have to be all or nothing. Publishers require only the author&rsquo;s permission to publish an article, not a wholesale transfer of copyright. So, a &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; is often desirable, for example by authors adding an appropriate \"scholarship dissemination-friendly\" addendum to their contracts. (See below.)","\"Scholarship Dissemination-Friendly\" Addendum *******  Below is an example of relevant addendum language:Author&rsquo;s Retention of Rights. Notwithstanding any terms in the Publication Agreement to the contrary, AUTHOR and PUBLISHER agree that in addition to any rights under copyright retained by Author in the Publication Agreement, Author retains: (i) the rights to reproduce, to distribute, to publicly perform, and to publicly display the Article in any medium for noncommercial purposes; (ii) the right to prepare derivative works from the Article; and (iii) the right to authorize others to make any non-commercial use of the Article so long as Author receives credit as author and the journal in which the Article has been published is cited as the source of first publication of the Article. For example, Author may make and distribute copies in the course of teaching and research and may post the Article on personal or institutional Web sites and in other open-access digital repositories.Or, generate an addendum that can be attached to a publisher's contract:  Science Commons/SPARC Author Rights Addendum  ","SHERPA/RoMEO ******* One may use the Sherpa/RoMEO website to find a summary of permissions that are normally given as part of each publisher's copyright transfer agreement.Though it doesn&rsquo;t include all publishers, the number listed is fairly large.The entry for each publisher also lists conditions or restrictions imposed by the publisher which govern archiving rights or activities.","Use of the Guide ******* "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=47385&sid=349299"}

Fair use is a flexible balancing test that is difficult to define apart from the specific factual circumstances in which it has been applied by courts.  Be wary of fair use &ldquo;scales&rdquo; that attempt to assign a weight to each factor to be weighed against the others; the doctrine requires determining fairness on the whole in the particular context. Explanation of Each Factor:Purpose and character of the use Consider: is the use educational or commercial? Is it a non-profit use or a use for profit? Is the use transformative or iterative?Educational use does not automatically render a use fair; this is just one helpful factor.  For example, note that many materials are created specifically for the educational market and fair use cannot be relied upon to make these works &ldquo;free.&rdquo;Many recent cases have centered on whether the use is transformative or iterative, with transformative use more likely to be considered fair. Transformative uses include such use of portions of a work in parodies or thumbnail images that reproduce a full&ndash;sized image but for a different purpose, such as a search engine. Many educational uses are iterative in that they require the use of exact copies, which is usually less defensible than the use of limited portions of a work for a new purpose or in a new way.The more transformative a use is, the less likely it is to negatively affect the market for the original work, the fourth fair use factor.Nature of the copyrighted work Consider: is the work published or unpublished? Is it factual or creative?Unpublished works generally receive greater protection because the courts consider the copyright holder&rsquo;s right to first publication.  The fact that a work is unpublished does not bar a finding of fair use, but it makes the other factors more important. The more creative a work is, the stronger the copyright.  Purely factual data such as phone numbers do not receive copyright protection, but the selection and arrangement of factual data with some modicum of originality may.Amount and substantiality of the use Consider: how much of the work are you using?  How important is the portion you are using to the work as a whole?Using a smaller portion of a work is more likely to qualify as a fair use, though there are no rigid page number or percentage guidelines in the statute.This factor is analyzed qualitatively as well as quantitatively: a small amount of the work may be too much if it reproduces &ldquo;the heart of the work.&rdquo; Impact on the market Consider: how many copies are being made and how widely will they be distributed? Is the use spontaneous or is it repeated? Is the original for sale or license? A use for which there is a clear market or licensing mechanism is less likely to be fair than the use of a work for which there is no market or ckear potential market.Making numerous copies of a work weighs against a fair use finding; digital reproduction exacerbates this factor because digital copies are easier to copy and disseminate widely. The Supreme Court has stated that this factor is the most important, and the analysis of some of the other factors often lead to a market analysis.","What Can You Do? *******   In the teaching context, it may be useful to take the following steps to help qualify a use as fair and protect yourself and the University from infringement liability:When using third party material, perform a fair use analysis in good faith;Copy as little of the material as you can and still make the use you need;In an on-line setting, first check to see if the University Libraries has a license to the material; you may be able to point students to the material in an accessible database;Consider placing material in a password-protected environment that is available only to those enrolled in the class and terminate the students&rsquo; access to the material when class is over;Link to the material instead of copying it whenever possible;    If the use cannot be considered fair, ask the copyright holder for permission to use it.See the page on Reserves & Classroom for classroom copying exceptions.","Fair Use Decision Tools ******* Use these tools to help you decide what to do:","Fair Use Factors ******* Fair use is a doctrine under copyright law that permitscertain uses of a work without the copyright holder&rsquo;s permission.  Thefair use of a copyrighted work is an exception to the exclusive rights of acopyright holder. Fair use may be made of a copyrighted work for purposessuch as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copiesfor classroom use), scholarship, or research. However, the use of a work for one of these purpose does notautomatically qualify as a fair use:  anuanced analysis weighing four factors must be done for each factual scenario. Fair Use FactorsThe copyright statute statesthat the following four factors must be evaluated to determine in whether a useis fair:   the purpose and character of the use,     including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit     educational purposes;the nature of the     copyrighted work;the amount and     substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work     as a whole; andthe effect of the use upon the potential market     for or value of the copyrighted work.","Use of the Guide ******* "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=47385&sid=365929"}

The public owns these works, not an individual author or artist. Anyone can use a public domain work without obtaining permission, but no one can ever own it.  An important caveat regarding public domain material is that collections, new editions, and derivative works of public domain material may all be protected by copyright. With collections, an author could collect public domain works in a book or display them on a website, and the collection as a whole could be protected by copyright, even though individual works within it are not. There are four common ways that works arrive in the public domain:  &bull;    the copyright has expired. In general, the copyright term for a work created in the United States after 1977 (that is not a work made for hire) is the life of the author plus 70 years. All works published in the United States before 1923 are in the public domain.  Works published between 1923 and 1978 may be protected by copyright if they were published with notice and the copyright was renewed.  There are many other scenarios and sets of circumstances that affect the copyright term of these earlier works. Help with these complicated rules, and other scenarios can be found in this chart and in the U.S. Copyright Office's circular on the Duration of Copyright.    &bull;    the owner was required to renew the copyright and failed to do so. This is no longer required for works created after 1978.  &bull;    the owner deliberately places it in the public domain. To place an item in the public domain intentionally, a creator of a work would need to state that intent explicitly. If no such statement has been made, assume the work is protected by copyright. (Compare alternative licenses like Creative Commons.)  &bull;    copyright law does not protect this type of work. Copyright will not protect the titles of a book or movie, nor will it protect short phrases such as \"Make my day\" (though trademark protection may apply).  Copyright protection also doesn't cover facts, ideas or theories, although it may protect the expression of those ideas. Any work created by a U.S. government employee or officer is in the public domain, provided that the work is created in that person's official capacity. This applies only to U.S. government works, not the works of other national or state governments.   ","FAQs ******* Is a reprint of a public domainwork protected by copyright?Not generally, unless creative modifications are made.  These modifications could include theaddition or removal of any editorial material and artistic contributions, suchas illustrations or a new arrangement of the public domain material.  For these reasons, a new edition or aderivative work an existing public domain work may be not be able to bereproduced without the permission of the copyright owner.Is a translation of a public domain work protected by copyright?Yes. A translation is a derivative work of the original and is protected bycopyright.  The permission of thecopyright owner is needed to translate the owner&rsquo;s work into anotherlanguage.

It is impossible to provide a single definitive answer to which all publishers adhere. Publication policies are quite diverse and it is probable that most publishers have no ETD policy at all.Most dissertations that are later turned into books or journal articles are heavily revised in the process; the subsequent book or article is really quite different from the original dissertation. In such cases most publishers would not be worried that an open access ETD was a prior publication. Still, it may be wise to be cautious. If students plan to publish a dissertation they should consult potential publishers beforehand if they are concerned that making their dissertation open access will be considered a prior publication.Students may also request an embargo period during which their dissertation will not be openly accessible.MIT has provided a helpful chart that indicates selected publishers' policies on inclusion of previously published articles in a scholar's dissertation and their policies on acceptance of articles previously published as part of an eTD.For more information on this topic, including statistical analysis, please read An Investigation of ETDS as prior publications: Findings from the 2011 NDLTD Publishers&rsquo; Survey.

Section 110(1) of the Copyright Act permits instructorsand students in a non-profit educational institution to perform or display acopyrighted work in the course of face-to-face teaching activities, providedcertain requirements are met:  The     performance or display must be in a classroom or similar place devoted to     instruction (on-line environments are not included); andThe     performance or display of a motion picture or other audiovisual work must     be from a lawfully made copy (i.e., a home recording made from a     television broadcast is not included). Classroom CopiesUpon the passage of the currentCopyright Act in 1976, several leading groups representing copyright owners andpublishers came to an agreement on a set of guidelines with respect topermissible copying of materials for teaching purposes that may be useful inthe classroom context for spontaneous, limited copying. These guidelines are not intendedto limit or expand the more general fair use doctrine; they may instead providesome clarity for permissible activities in this limited context. The guidelines are available in the Copyright Offices's publication, Circular 21, Reproduction of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians.

The exception to thisrequirement would be use that is considered &ldquo;fair use&rdquo;.  Failure to obtainpermissions could result in legal action for infringement.There are several standard steps inthe process of acquiring permissions:Determine if permission is needed.Identify the copyright holder.Request permission in writing.If permission granted, acknowledge this appropriately.If permission cannot be obtained, be prepared to modify     your plans. Determine if permission is neededUse of materials in the public domain do not require     permissions.  See \"Public Domain\" tab in this guide.Use of copyrighted materials for fair use may bedone without permission, however, there is always a risk that your assessment ofthe fair use doctrine may be wrong.  Fair use judgments are made on afact-based, case-by-case basis (there is no one definitive test).  See &ldquo;Fair Use&rdquo; tab in     this guide. Identify the copyright holderPrior to the 1980&rsquo;s, authors were generally the     rights-holders; since then, publishers have increasingly retained these     rights.For print publications, begin by contacting the     publisher. Collective sites:  The Copyright     Clearance Center and RSiCopyright     can     provide easy access to many publishers and can provide for     nearly-instantaneous purchase of rights by credit card in many instances.      Both of these services will also seek permissions on your behalf if     you are not finding the publisher listed.  If none of these options     is fruitful, you&rsquo;ll need to contact the publisher directlyIndividual publishers:  Many publisher sites     provide a link to permissions information and/or contact     information.  If a book has been published in several forms (hardcover     and paperback, for example), often the first publisher     holds the rights you seek.  See links on this page for resources that     can be helpful in locating publishers.If the publisher does not own the rights, you may be     referred to the author (or the author&rsquo;s estate)     &hellip; or multiple authors or creators associated with the work you wish to     use.  Use of some works (those with text,     graphics, images, etc.) may require seeking permission from     a number of individuals including authors, photographers, artists and     others.Request permission in writingPermission may take the form of a &ldquo;license&rdquo; (granting     you the right to use the work), or a &ldquo;release&rdquo; (granting     you the right to use the work with the promise by the author not to sue).      Receiving permission may require payment of fees.Allow adequate time for receiving a reply.  Requesting permission does not protect you from     infringement if you have not received a reply.The Association of American     Publishers recommends that all of the following information be     included in your request: author's, editor's,      translator's full name(s)title, edition and volume      number of book or journalcopyright date ISBN for books, ISSN for      magazines and journals numbers of the exact pages,      figures and illustrations if you are requesting a chapter      or more, both exact chapter(s)      and exact page numbers whether material will be used      alone or combined with other photocopied material number of copies to be produced      name of college or university course name and number semester and year in which      material will be used instructor's full name method of reproduction (photocopying,      scanning, etc.) See the list of sites showing model permission request     letters in the left margin of this guide.Acknowledge permission grantedIf you are successful in obtainingpermission, this permission is noted, generally, in any of the following ways,or according to any special instructions given by the grantor:Footnote     in the textSource     note to a tableCredit     line listed under an illustration.  See     the appropriate style guide for your discipline for more information.If permission cannot be obtained, be prepared to change your plansYou may need to use less of the material     than you had planned, or not use it altogether.

Consequently, faculty, students, staff are encouraged to retain their ownership of the scholarly materials they author.

","What is Open Access? ******* BostonCollege Libraries strongly support the principle of open access to scholarly literature. The Libraries are a signatory of the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI). The latter defines \"open access\" as follows:  By \"open access\" to this literature, we mean itsfree availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read,download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of thesearticles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use themfor any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriersother than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. Theonly constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role forcopyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrityof their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.In addition tobenefiting consumers of scholarly information, open access also benefits scholars, increasing the visibility, influence, and potential benefit of theirresearch. It helps redress global inequity of access to scholarship bydismantling cost barriers to research dissemination. And it returns researchresults more swiftly and readily to the public, who provide much of the fundingfor scholarly work.","Selected Open Access Initiatives ******* ","OA Trends on Campus ******* Examples of common Open Access (OA) practices on college campuses include faculty refereed OA journalsOA electronic theses and dissertationsdigitalrepositories highlighting faculty and student scholarship.In fact, faculty at some institutions have voted to mandate that their scholarly articles be OA through their digital repositories, Harvard, and MIT being among the most prominent. ","News @ BC ******* Scholarly Communication News@BC.

Particularly apt is his observation (from Open Access Overview) thatOA is compatible with copyright, peer review, revenue(even profit), print, preservation, prestige, career-advancement,indexing, and other features and supportive services associated withconventional scholarly literature. . . . . The primary difference is that the bills are not paid by readers and hence do not function as access barriers.To read more views, announcements etc. of Peter Suber and others consult the Open Access Tracking Project (OATP).","Use of the Guide ******* ","Why Publish OA? ******* Many studies show a citation advantage for open access articles.

Please take a look at Boston College's statement on academic integrity, and the GSSW's own academic regulations.","What is Plagiarism? ******* What is plagiarism:According to BC's policy on Academic Integrity  \"Plagiarism is the act of taking the words, ideas, data, illustrations, or statements of another person or source, and presenting them as one's own. Each student is responsible for learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting, quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly acknowledged.\"  Refer to BC's comprehensive Academic Integrity Policy. ","Plagiarism: How to Avoid It ******* Avoiding plagiarism:Take excellent notes. Plagiarism often stems from sloppy research and subsequent rewriting rather than a deliberate desire to cheat. Nevertheless, even unintentional failure to cite sources correctly and honestly may constitute plagiarism. Many students mistakenly take bad notes during the research process. They write someone else&rsquo;s text verbatim on a card or on their computer and forget quotation marks. When they write the paper and refer to their notes, they forget the text on the card or computer is another author&rsquo;s and not their own. Any reader who recognizes the original text believes that the student has cheated. This can lead to tough penalties. Tips:Take excellent notes, utilize them effectively, write the entire paper yourself, and document sources well and honestly.Ask your professor. If you're not sure about citing something, check with your instructor.Plan your time carefully - oftentimes students make careless mistakes when under pressure to complete a paper or assignment.Further assistance:","Academic Integrity Tutorial ******* Please take a look at Boston College's own Academic Integrity Tutorial."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=75259&sid=3053844"}

Resources and techniques listed were chosen especially for this class.  ","Quick Introduction to the Research Process ******* You need to find information on mercury emissions as a component of air pollution ...  Here is one approach to this process:1.  Do some background reading to make sure that you understand the basics of your topic and to collect (and understand) useful terms for searching.  The better your understanding of the terminology (and how it relates), the better your chances of retrieving relevant articles.2.  Look in Holmes for books that cover your topic -- books may be broader in scope, and include a chapter on your topic, or they may be focused in detail on your topic.  Look at the Holmes search tips on the Find It at BC page of this guide.  Books (often called \"monographs\") can be a great way of strengthening your understanding.3. Look for Review Articles on your topic.  Review articles summarize what is known about a given topic, written by an expert.  These are widely used in the sciences, by both specialists and non-specialists.  These articles are not reporting on original research results, but are surveying the results of many earlier studies. 4.  As you start learning, see if you can construct the outlines of an introduction to the topic.  What might you want to know about mercury emissions?  Here are just a few possible questions to get you started:How big a problem is it?  What are common causes/sources?What's the chemistry behind this?What's so bad about mercury emissions?Is it getting worse?What can be done to lessen mercury in the atmosphere?5.  Using these questions and the terms you've collected, now try searching for articles about your topic.  Try one of the Boston College Libraries' journal article databases selected for this course -- these provide quality/reliable information, and you won't be overwhelmed by millions of hits. (On the same page, see the box listing techniques for better search results.)  Find It at BC will help you in tracking down the full-text of the articles you identify.  6.  As you keep searching, you'll be learning more about your topic -- use the new terms and new connections that you uncover to do more searching -- often you will find things that you didn't find the first time through.7.  Try out some science-focused search engines.  Also, try out some of the tips for Google searching ... and be sure to evaluate the websites you choose. 8.   As you find interesting articles and other references, organize/manage them in your personal database.  RefWorks can be a great way to manage your references so that you can find them when you need them.  Use RefWorks when you're writing your paper to insert footnotes in the text and to create a bibliography when you're done.9.  Finally, just like you need to use APA or MLA styles when writing papers for other courses, chemistry has its own style guidelines.

Typically, primary sources are contemporary to the events and individuals being researched.Primary sources differ both in content and format from discipline to discipline. Below are examples of primary sources used by:Historians: the book-keeping records of a 1920s small tobacconist; a stone inscription; the handwritten will of a nineteenth century farmer; Abraham Lincoln's ceremonial sword; the hieroglyphics on the temples of Luxor in EgyptPolitical Scientists: the ballot form of the last mayoral race in Boston; the hearings of the 1973 Senate Watergate Committee.Sociologists: the questionnaire used for some surveyLiterary Scholars: original manuscript of Tennyson's poem In MemoriamPhysicists: rock from the moonBiologists: blood samples from a gorillaPsychologists: Notes taken when investigating an individual's post-traumatic stress disorder","Secondary Sources ******* A secondary source is not an original source. It has no direct physical connection to the person or event being studied. Examples of secondary sources might include: history books, articles in encyclopedias, prints of paintings, replicas of art objects, reviews of research, academic articles. Secondary Sources are sometimes categorized as:Intentional documents, e.g. biographies, memoirs, yearbooks that are composed deliberately to present a record of the past.Unpremeditated documents, e.g. novels, paintings. These are created for a particular immediate purpose, but there is no real intention that they are to be utilized for historical evidence at a later date. For example, Dickens's Little Dorrit is a novel but it might also be useful for gaining insight into aspects of London in the 1850s.It is often difficult to distinguish clearly between primary and secondary sources. Some evidence can be both, at the same time. The first edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica was a secondary source when first published in 1768; but today it is a primary source to historians.

There is not one standard way of doing U.S. Latino/a theology; neither is there one single topic that occupies the reflection of Hispanic theologians and communities. U.S. Latino/a theology is as diverse as the Hispanic people and the issues that affect their lives. U.S. Latino/a theologians enrich the world of theological reflection with their unique contributions to the various particular theological fields: Systematic / Constructive TheologyTheological and Social EthicsBiblical scholarshipPractical / Pastoral TheologyThe sources of U.S. Latino/a theology are those of traditional theology as well as the lived experience of Latinos/as living in the United States in dialogue with other traditions: intellectual, religious, social, and cultural. ","Some Classic Works in U.S. Hispanic Catholic Theology ******* The theological production among Hispanic Catholics in the United States has abundantly exploded since the 1990's. Two major reasons have led to this welcomed development: 1) The increasing number of U.S. Latino/a theologians working in universities and ecclesial contexts who are both reflecting and publishing on a more regular basis2) The multilevel engagement of early questions such as the religious experience of Hispanic Catholics in the United States and Hispanic culture; new questions such as the public voice of U.S. Hispanic Catholics as they asume leadership in the next phase of the American Catholic experience in the 21st century; and major constructive projects leading to a rereading of classical Christian theological themes such as Tradition, Salvation, Ecumenism, Christology, Ecclesiology and Evangelization, among several others, from the perspective of the U.S. Hispanic Catholic experience.If you come for the first time to the study of U.S. Hispanic Catholic theology, you may want to explore the following foundational works:","U.S. Latino/Hispanic Catholic Theology - Collective Works ******* One of the key characteristics of U.S. Latino/Hispanic theology is its collaborative nature or what Latino/a theologians call Teolog\u00eda de conjunto. The following are important collections that bring together importnat voices articulating different methods and concerns:","General Introductions to U.S. Latino/a Theology ******* The following works provide general introductions to the world of U.S. Latino/a Theology.

Most documents are available in eight different languages.

You can directly quote an author or paraphrase an author. These are just a few examples of how to cite sources within your paper. ","Direct Quoting ******* You can directly quote from an author as long as you include the author's name, the year the book/article was published, and the page number of the quotation.Here is an example: &ldquo;Just as in direct service, administrative,or community organizing practice, we become effective policy advocates only aswe learn key concepts and develop pivotal skills&rdquo; (Jansson,1999, p. 19). Make sure that Jansson's work is fully cited in your references page.","Paraphrasing ******* Writing an author's words in your own words is perfectly acceptable as long as you acknowledge the original author. Here is an example of a citation with a single author:Policy advocates need to have a clear idea as to what kind of changes they would like to see in a specific agency, community, or within society as a whole (Jannsen, 1999).Remember to provide a full citation of the author's work on your references page.Here is an example of a citation with two authors:Social work is a profession with a dual focus (Popple & Leighninger, 2011).","What about Websites? ******* Citing a website within text can be tricky because a website may not have a traditional page number, author, or year. In this scenario, you can do the following:Instead of an author, use a short version of the title in quotations.If there is no date, use the abbreviation \"nd.\"In place of a page number, give a name of the section of the website, and a paragraph number.Here is an example:(\"National Center for Education Statistics,\" n.d, What's New section, para 2).","Citing a Source Cited in Your Source ******* Sometimes you may use information cited in another source. For example, you may want to use information that the author \"Smith\" cited from the author \"Jackson.\" There are two possible ways of handling it. You can:Find the article written by \"Jackson\" and cite directly from that author.Name \"Jackson\" as a source in your paraphrase, but only cite \"Smith\" in the references page.Here is an example:Jackson's study (as cited in Smith, 2009) suggests....You would only need to cite \"Smith\" in your references page, since this is the author you have read.","For More Information *******    For more information about formatting your paper, please see chapter seven of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=132193&sid=1153947"}

Each student is responsible for learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting, quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly acknowledged.\"  Refer to BC's comprehensive Academic Integrity Policy.Avoiding plagiarism:Take excellent notes. Plagiarism often stems from sloppy research and subsequent rewriting rather than a deliberate desire to cheat. Nevertheless, even unintentional failure to cite sources correctly and honestly may constitute plagiarism. Many students mistakenly take bad notes during the research process. They write someone else&rsquo;s text verbatim on a card or on their computer and forget quotation marks. When they write the paper and refer to their notes, they forget the text on the card or computer is another author&rsquo;s and not their own. Any reader who recognizes the original text believes that the student has cheated. This can lead to tough penalties. Tips:Take excellent notes, utilize them effectively, write the entire paper yourself, and document sources well and honestly.Ask your professor. If you're not sure about citing something, check with your instructor.Plan your time carefully - often times students make careless mistakes when under pressure to complete a paper or assignment.Further assistance:"],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=147985&sid=1257463"}

Each student is responsible for learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting, quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly acknowledged.\"  Refer to BC's comprehensive Academic Integrity Policy.Avoiding plagiarism:Take excellent notes. Plagiarism often stems from sloppy research and subsequent rewriting rather than a deliberate desire to cheat. Nevertheless, even unintentional failure to cite sources correctly and honestly may constitute plagiarism. Many students mistakenly take bad notes during the research process. They write someone else&rsquo;s text verbatim on a card or on their computer and forget quotation marks. When they write the paper and refer to their notes, they forget the text on the card or computer is another author&rsquo;s and not their own. Any reader who recognizes the original text believes that the student has cheated. This can lead to tough penalties. Tips:Take excellent notes, utilize them effectively, write the entire paper yourself, and document sources well and honestly.Ask your professor. If you're not sure about citing something, check with your instructor.Plan your time carefully - often times students make careless mistakes when under pressure to complete a paper or assignment.Further assistance:","Style Manuals ******* "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=148072&sid=1797683"}

Each student is responsible for learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting, quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly acknowledged.\"  Refer to BC's comprehensive Academic Integrity Policy.Avoiding plagiarism:Take excellent notes. Plagiarism often stems from sloppy research and subsequent rewriting rather than a deliberate desire to cheat. Nevertheless, even unintentional failure to cite sources correctly and honestly may constitute plagiarism. Many students mistakenly take bad notes during the research process. They write someone else&rsquo;s text verbatim on a card or on their computer and forget quotation marks. When they write the paper and refer to their notes, they forget the text on the card or computer is another author&rsquo;s and not their own. Any reader who recognizes the original text believes that the student has cheated. This can lead to tough penalties. Tips:Take excellent notes, utilize them effectively, write the entire paper yourself, and document sources well and honestly.Ask your professor. If you're not sure about citing something, check with your instructor.Plan your time carefully - often times students make careless mistakes when under pressure to complete a paper or assignment.Further assistance:","Style Manuals ******* "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=148428&sid=1797690"}

The language used for the database interface is often a good hint, but when in doubt, try both.  Some databases (MLA International Bibliography, for example) even allow you to browse the thesaurus of specific descriptors used.  Use the database's wildcard symbol(often * or ?) to truncate a search term poet*  retrieves poet, poets, poetry, poetic, poetics ...Use quotation marks to searchfor an exact phrase  For example: \"magic realism\"Use Boolean operators whenallowed AND&ndash; use to combine concepts (when both must be present)OR &ndash;use for synonyms (when either term could be present) NOT &ndash;use for words or phrases to exclude.Use parentheses to group termsExample:(utopia* or distopia*) AND (\"magic realism\" OR fantas* NOT \"science fiction\") ","Google Tips ******* "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=148428&sid=1798212"}

Resources and techniques listed chosen especially for this class.  ","More BC Research Guides ******* Try the Boston College Libraries' General Science Research Guide to find many additional resources that might be useful for this class.Try Libguides.bc.edu for many more research guides created for the Boston College community.","Quick Introduction to the Research Process ******* You need to find information on mercury emissions as a component of air pollution ...  Here is one approach to this process:1.  Do some background reading to make sure that you understand the basics of your topic and to collect (and understand) useful terms for searching.  The better your understanding of the terminology (and how it relates), the better your chances of retrieving relevant articles.2.  Look in Holmes for books that cover your topic -- books may be broader in scope, and include a chapter on your topic, or they may be focused in detail on your topic.  Look at the Holmes search tips on the Find It at BC page of this guide.  Books (often called \"monographs\") can be a great way of strengthening your understanding.3. Look for Review Articles on your topic.  Review articles summarize what is known about a given topic, written by an expert.  These are widely used in the sciences, by both specialists and non-specialists.  These articles are not reporting on original research results, but are surveying the results of many earlier studies. 4.  As you start learning, see if you can construct the outlines of an introduction to the topic.  What might you want to know about mercury emissions?  Here are just a few possible questions to get you started:How big a problem is it?  What are common causes/sources?What's the chemistry behind this?What's so bad about mercury emissions?Is it getting worse?What can be done to lessen mercury in the atmosphere?5.  Using these questions and the terms you've collected, now try searching for articles about your topic.  Try one of the Boston College Libraries' journal article databases selected for this course -- these provide quality/reliable information, and you won't be overwhelmed by millions of hits. (On the same page, see the box listing techniques for better search results.)  Find It at BC will help you in tracking down the full-text of the articles you identify.  6.  As you keep searching, you'll be learning more about your topic -- use the new terms and new connections that you uncover to do more searching -- often you will find things that you didn't find the first time through.7.  Try out some science-focused search engines.  Also, try out some of the tips for Google searching ... and be sure to evaluate the websites you choose. 8.   As you find interesting articles and other references, organize/manage them in your personal database.  RefWorks can be a great way to manage your references so that you can find them when you need them.  Use RefWorks when you're writing your paper to insert footnotes in the text and to create a bibliography when you're done.9.  Finally, just like you need to use APA or MLA styles when writing papers for other courses, chemistry has its own style guidelines.

The history collections are particularly enriched by the archives and special collections material preserved at the John J.

Chemistry (Boston College).  Marilyn was the Chemistry Librarian here at BC from 1971 - 2003, and she was much loved, for many reasons, but especially for her warmth, her strong service orientation and her pioneering work in library technology.  She particularly loved working with students.   This summer, to honor Marilyn, Dr. Larry Clifford has given us a gift of technology, especially useful for students, on the passing of his wife, Joyce Clifford, a close friend of Marilyn's.  Dr. Clifford's gift provides access to the Royal Society of Chemistry \"Organic Chemistry\" e-book collection 2000 - 2010.

The Archives staff:  works with BC schools, departments, and offices to determine which of the records they create in the course of their activities should be preserved for future use  works with students, alumni, faculty, and friends of the University to collect papers, graphic materials, recordings, and artifacts that document life at Boston College and the University's history  promotes and supports activities that contribute to understanding of and research about Boston College history Material in the University Archives is arranged in a series of \"Record Groups\" and \"Subgroups\" reflecting the Boston College's reporting structure. A list of the Record Groups can be found here.  Some -- but not all -- materials in the University Archives are represented in the catalog. To browse the cataloged materials  in Holmes, the Boston College Libraries online discovery tool, do a search for \"BC Archive\" and refine the results by clicking on Archives & Manuscripts under Material Type. If you're not sure about what we have, please ask! Just contact the Burns Library reference desk or archives staff.For more detailed information about University Archives at Boston College, please consult this Library Guide.","What are Archives & Manuscripts at BC? ******* Archives & Manuscripts is the department at the Burns Library that manages primary source material.Archives and manuscripts are words that describe the kinds of primary sources we manage.Archives can be a general term pertaining to all materials with enduring value created by individuals (papers) or organizations (records) during the course of everyday affairs OR the repository that holds that kind of material (the Burns Library). However, at Boston College, we primarily use the term archives to mean the University Archives, which are the office records of Boston College, but it also applies to any collection of organizational records.While the term manuscripts can be limited to hand-written documents, at Boston College, we generally use it more broadly and apply it to all collections of personal papers.","Manuscripts (personal papers) ******* The Burns Library holds collections of personal papers in a number of collecting areas. Personal papers often include correspondence, photographs, diaries, documents, drafts of literary works, notes, recordings, and/or other material created and collected during the course of a person's life. These materials become significant for research purposes due to the time, place, or circumstance they document; the person whose life they illuminate; the relationships and points of view they reveal, etc.Conducting research with personal papers is rewarding -- it is often \"original research\" that no one else has done exactly the same way before! It is time-consuming, though. Please plan time for the occasional false start, dead end, or illegible document.","Archives (organizational records) ******* The Burns Library is the repository for some organizational records. Organizational records often include memos, correspondence, agreements, meeting minutes, newsletters and other publications, annual reports, photographs, recordings, and/or ledgers. These materials sometimes serve an ongoing administrative need, but also can be used for historical research.An example of records at the Burns Library is The Eire Society of Boston records. The Eire Society of Boston was founded in 1937 primarily for the purpose of promoting interest in Irish culture and civilization. Their records include meeting minutes, correspondence, programs, publications, and financial records. Because this organization is still extant, the collection is growing.Please note: sometimes portions of organizational records are available only to members of that organization.","Archives Stacks ******* The Archives & Manuscripts stacks at the Burns Library are closed, like all the stacks at the Burns Library, but here is a glimpse. The Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Congressional Papers are primarily stored in one place in uniformly-sized gray boxes.","Quick Search Tips ******* In Holmes Advanced Search consider these strategies in addition to your search terms:Limit Your Searchby Search Scope \"Burns Library\"by Material Type \"Archives & Manuscripts\"Use Local Collection Names (Change \"Anywhere in record\" to \"Local collection\")\"MSS ARCHIVE\" (for papers or organizational records)\"BC ARCHIVE\" (for Boston College University Archives)\"FINDING AID\" (for collections with finding aids online)Use Subject Keywords for Form/Genre (Change \"Anywhere in record\" to \"Subject\")\"Sources\"\"Letters\"\"Correspondence\"\"Manuscripts\"\"Photographs\"Try Keywords in Title (Change \"Anywhere in record\" to \"Title\")\"Papers\"\"Collection\"\"Records\"","What is a finding aid? ******* A record in the library catalog will help you find archival collections of interest. However, archival collections are complex resources comprised of unique things created and collected uniquely. One listing is not enough to help you navigate to the relevant box or folder. Finding aids help you get there! A finding aid is document that describes the materials in context and includes information about the materials' history (provenance), a biographical or historical note about who created or collected the material, a description of the scope of the material (size, subjects, media), statements about organization and arrangement, and an inventory of the material itself.Finding aids are often linked to records in the catalog. Unfortunately, some finding aids are available only in the Burns Library. Contact a librarian or archivist if you need help!Photo by Evan Long (http://www.flickr.com/clover_1/) "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=175557&sid=1523939"}

Scholarly researchers generally choose the latter type in which to publish. What is a Peer-Reviewed Journal?Many academic journals are called  peer-reviewed or refereed journals. Articles submitted to this type of journal for publication consideration are evaluated by several reviewers who are expert in the field covered by the article. These then recommend whether or not the article should be published. Thus, such articles having gone through a rigorous review process tend to have more credibility and intellectual prestige. A very informative video is Peer Review in 5 Minutes (created by North Carolina State University) that well encapsulates the peer-review process.CharacteristicsPeer-Reviewed or Scholarly JournalPopular Journal or MagazineLengthUsually long articles focusing on in-depth analysis of topics.

Typically, primary sources are contemporary to the events and individuals being researched.Primary sources differ both in content and format from discipline to discipline. Below are examples of primary sources used by:Historians: the book-keeping records of a 1920s small tobacconist; a stone inscription; the handwritten will of a nineteenth century farmer; Abraham Lincoln's ceremonial sword; the hieroglyphics on the temples of Luxor in EgyptPolitical Scientists: the ballot form of the last mayoral race in Boston; the hearings of the 1973 Senate Watergate Committee.Sociologists: the questionnaire used for some surveyLiterary Scholars: original manuscript of Tennyson's poem In MemoriamPhysicists: rock from the moonBiologists: blood samples from a gorillaPsychologists: Notes taken when investigating an individual's post-traumatic stress disorder","Secondary Sources ******* A secondary source is not an original source. It has no direct physical connection to the person or event being studied. Examples of secondary sources might include: history books, articles in encyclopedias, prints of paintings, replicas of art objects, reviews of research, academic articles. Secondary Sources are sometimes categorized as:Intentional documents, e.g. biographies, memoirs, yearbooks that are composed deliberately to present a record of the past.Unpremeditated documents, e.g. novels, paintings. These are created for a particular immediate purpose, but there is no real intention that they are to be utilized for historical evidence at a later date. For example, Dickens's Little Dorrit is a novel but it might also be useful for gaining insight into aspects of London in the 1850s.It is often difficult to distinguish clearly between primary and secondary sources. Some evidence can be both, at the same time. The first edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica was a secondary source when first published in 1768; but today it is a primary source to historians.

The list of offices and their identifying \"record group\" numbers is attached.","Faculty and Alumni Papers ******* Faculty and Alumni papers more closely represent personal papers than office records.

This can be an issue if reproductions are desired for other than personal use.Not all photographs are dated. This can be frustrating; sometimes detective work can help you (what vintage are the cars? how old does that famous person look? etc.).When using a photograph for research, consider: what was just beyond the frame of this photo? who took the photo and did they have an agenda? are the details informative?Our photograph collections are too big and idiosyncratic for reasonable indexing. Ask us to look for something for you!","Theses & Dissertations ******* For many years Boston College has conferred graduate degrees which require a thesis or dissertation for completion. Print copies of those papers, with the signature page, are official University Records. Generally, these print copies are not the \"use copy.\" You can find theses and dissertations through ProQuest and, often, on microfilm (kept in the Government Documents section of O'Neill Library). If the paper desired is of a vintage not included in ProQuest and it is not available on microfilm, then the University Archives copy becomes the use copy. When this is the case, contact the archives staff to request it; you need to know the author and the year of graduation. It will take 2 to 4 days to retrieve the work and will only be available for use in the Reading Room. Copying is likely to be prohibited both due to the condition of the binding and copyright.Photo by Thomas Ford Memorial Library (http://flic.kr/p/u5uVz)","Images on Flickr ******* Examples of some of the photographs and other materials in the University Archives and other collections at the John J.

Newton College of the Sacred Heart yearbook. Newton, Mass., [The College].Newton College of the Sacred Heart was a women's college that opened its doors in 1946. The first class graduated in 1950. In 1971, the college founded the Institute of Open Education, which later became Cambridge College. However due to the coeducation of many formerly all-male colleges in universities (Boston College became fully co-educational in 1970), Newton College of the Sacred Heart struggled financially and in June of 1974 merged with Boston College. The last official class to graduate from Newton College of the Sacred Heart graduated in 1975.

","Student Newspapers (Heights and 885) ******* The Heights student newspaper of Boston College and the 885 student newspaper of Newton College of the Sacred Heart are now available online through newspapers.bc.edu.The Heights began publication in 1919. Issues from November 1919-June 2010 are online through newspapers.bc.edu. For current news, see the paper's website: http://www.bcheights.com. Copyright for 1970 to the present is held by the Heights, Inc. Copyright for 1964-1970 is held by the Trustees of Boston College. Issues from 1919-1963 are in the public domain.The 885 was the student newspaper of Newton College of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic women&rsquo;s college in operation from 1946 through 1975 when it merged with Boston College. Boston College recognizes the alumna of Newton College of the Sacred Heart and considers these graduates part of the legacy that is the Boston College Alumni.Both newspapers are browse-able, searchable, printable, save-able, and email-able. Each is useful for the same reason other newspapers are: it provides a local, contemporary perspective of issues of local, regional, national, or international import. However, these are written in the voices of Boston College and Newton College students, a voice often difficult to find even in the archival record."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=184435&sid=2429545"}

The latter defines \"open access\" as follows:By \"open access\" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.In addition to benefiting consumers of scholarly information, open access also benefits scholars, increasing the visibility, influence, and potential benefit of their research. It helps redress global inequity of access to scholarship by dismantling cost barriers to research dissemination. And it returns research results more swiftly and readily to the public, who provide much of the funding for scholarly work.For definitions of frequently used open access terms, take a look at the Open Access Glossary.","What are the Benefits? ******* ","Why is Open Access  Important? ******* ","What's in This Guide? ******* The purpose of this guide is to help the Boston College community explore and understand new models of scholarly publishing.

Your work as an author is copyrighted to you the moment you fix it in a tangible medium of expression (typing it into Word and clicking Save, for example). You retain that copyright until you give some or all of it away.Myth: Open Access will destroy the scholarly publishing system and cause journals to fail. Fact: New models are emerging in scholarly publishing. One safeguard that many journals implement is a time-limited embargo on open access. Journals recoup most of the publishing costs within the first year of publication. Articles can then be made open access without loss of revenue.  Many journal publishers (Oxford, Cambridge, Wiley, Sage, etc.) have also decided to change their business model from subscription-only, cost-recovery, to a hybrid model, in which open accesss articles are published alonside traditional ones. Article processing fees are charged to recoup the publishers' costs. Hybrid journal policies should be examined carefully, however; some allow free access to the article but do not allow any of the derivative uses associated with true open access. See \"When is Open Access Not Open Access?\" Myth: Open Access journals are not peer-reviewed and are of low quality. Fact: Open Access journals, just like any other journal, can be peer-reviewed or not, depending on the journal policy. The fact that the journal is open access says nothing about whether it is peer-reviewed. Most scholarly open access journals are peer-reviewed. Myth: If I want to publish open access I have to submit my article to an open access journal. Fact: You can submit and publish your article in any journal you like and still make it available open access in our research repository, eScholarship@BC. You just need to plan for this in advance. You can send the article to eScholarship at the same time that you submit it to the journal of your choice, giving BC the right to make it available (subject to an embargo period if you like). Myth: If I try to retain some rights, publishers will think I am difficult and will not want to publish my work. Fact: Publishers are very used to dealing with these requests at this point. Far from being unusual, the retention of rights by authors is becoming a mainstream choice.  Approximately 60% of academic journals allow some form or open access archiving without any use of an addendum to the contract.  For a searchable database of publisher policies about copyright and archiving, explore the SHERPA/RoMEO site. Myth:  Publishing my work open access is a nice, altruistic thing to do, but there is nothing in it for me. Fact: Open access publishing does help address inequities in access to knowledge globally. Few people in the world have access to the resources we have here at Boston College. But, in addition, most studies show a clear citation advantage for open access publications. Open access publications are cited more often than those that are subscription-only and citation counts are still important factors in tenure and promotion decisions.","More on OA Myths ******* Peter Suber, a prominent OA advocate and activist, currently at the Berkman Center for the Internet & Society at Harvard University, has written extensively about the perils of OA myths:","Peter Suber on OA ******* "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=229599&sid=1899908"}

Many publishers now anticipate an author's legitimate need to distribute and repurpose his work and no longer require exclusive rights to publication. Some publishers balance their interest in recouping publishing costs with the author&rsquo;s desire to disseminate their ideas broadly, placing a short-term embargo on the open access archiving of the work.

Below are examples of primary sources used by:Historians: the book-keeping records of a 1920s small tobacconist; a stone inscription; the handwritten will of a nineteenth century farmer; Abraham Lincoln's ceremonial sword; the hieroglyphics on the temples of Luxor in EgyptPolitical Scientists: the ballot form of the last mayoral race in Boston; the hearings of the 1973 Senate Watergate Committee.Sociologists: the questionnaire used for some surveyLiterary Scholars: original manuscript of Tennyson's poem In MemoriamPhysicists: rock from the moonBiologists: blood samples from a gorillaPsychologists: Notes taken when investigating an individual's post-traumatic stress disorder","Secondary Sources ******* A secondary source is not an original source. It has no direct physical connection to the person or event being studied. Examples of secondary sources might include: history books, articles in encyclopedias, prints of paintings, replicas of art objects, reviews of research, academic articles. Secondary Sources are sometimes categorized as:Intentional documents, e.g. biographies, memoirs, yearbooks that are composed deliberately to present a record of the past.Unpremeditated documents, e.g. novels, paintings. These are created for a particular immediate purpose, but there is no real intention that they are to be utilized for historical evidence at a later date. For example, Dickens's Little Dorrit is a novel but it might also be useful for gaining insight into aspects of London in the 1850s.It is often difficult to distinguish clearly between primary and secondary sources. Some evidence can be both, at the same time. The first edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica was a secondary source when first published in 1768; but today it is a primary source to historians.

The database comprises a complete set (over 2,000) of File Reports, 1937-1972. The range of topics covered includes popular culture (with reports on cinema-going, radio and music, and the advent of television); consumerism, branding and fashion (including the rise of department stores and the New Look); sex, marriage, and the family, as well as attitudes to war, politics and America, Russia and Europe. In addition, the database has many other publications, surveys, diaries, and photographs. All material is full text searchable.For our purposes there is a tremendous amount of material about how the average Briton lived during the Second World War as well as their attitudes about a vast range of topics\"The origin of the Mass Observation Organisation was first announced in a 30 January, 1937 letter to the New Statesman and Nation signed by Tom Harrisson, an anthropologist who had worked in Borneo and the New Hebrides, Charles Madge, poet and journalist, and Humphrey Jennings, a documentary film maker. The letter recommended that a new research project be established, the goal of which would be an &ldquo;anthropology at home &hellip; a science of ourselves&rdquo;. Accordingly, they proposed new areas of anthropological exploration of everyday life in Britain including such pedestrian, and in some cases arcane, areas as &ldquo;behaviour of people at war memorials; shouts and gestures of motorists; the aspidistra cult; the anthropology of football pools; bathroom behavior; beards, armpits, eyebrows; anti-Semitism; distribution, diffusion and significance of the dirty joke; funerals and undertakers; female taboos about eating; the private lives of midwives.&rdquo; The authors, holding that national life was rife with myth and superstition and that a large chasm existed between true public opinion and social behavior and what was publicized as such by the Government and the press, considered that their proposed Mass Observation project would reveal in a scientific manner the truth about what the average Briton did and believed. Though the MO&rsquo;s collection techniques varied, there were two principal strategies: a) teams of investigators were paid to observe and record in detail ordinary individuals&rsquo; conversation and behavior in a variety of public situations such as religious gatherings, leisure and sporting activities, other meetings, normal pursuits in the street and at work; b) a National Panel of volunteers who kept diaries, personal reports on various topics, and completed questionnaires sent by the central organization. MO continued its activities through World War II and into the first part of the 1950s. Gradually a focus on consumer behavior rather than social issues became more prominent. In 1949 Mass Observation was registered as a limited company and for the next couple of decades it was a commercial market research organization. In the 1970s MO began a new life as an important archive at the University of Sussex. Then in 1981, with renewed interest in the original goals of the organization, MO was re-launched and fresh data began to be collected from new panels and questionnaires. MO continues to this day.\" [B.

However, archival collections are complex resources comprised of unique things created and collected uniquely. One listing is not enough to help you navigate to the relevant box or folder.Finding aids help you get there! A finding aid is document that describes the materials in context and includes information about the materials' history (provenance), a biographical or historical note about who created or collected the material, a description of the scope of the material (size, subjects, media), statements about organization and arrangement, and an inventory of the material itself.Finding aids are often linked to records in the catalog. Unfortunately, some finding aids are available only in the Burns Library. Contact a librarian or archivist if you need help!

You can also specify dates to search, add index terms, or limit your search to specific segments of articles (e.g. headline, byline, lead paragaph).","New York Times FAQ ******* Q. Can the Libraries get a Times digital subscription that we can use?A. No. The Times does not offer multi-user subscriptions for libraries and their patrons. However, through an arrangement with Quality of Student Life Committee (QSLC), Boston College faculty, students and administrators are eligible to receive a 50 percent discount off individual subscriptions via nytimes.com and smartphones.  (Go to NYTimes.com/CollegeDS  and follow the directions there.)Q. Does that mean I can't access any of the Times content on their site or on my smartphone or iPad without an individual subscription?A. The Times allows users to access up to 10 articles on its website per month with no cost. The Top News section will remain free on smartphone and tablet apps. Beyond that, digital subscriptions are required.  Subscribers to the print newspaper get free access via nytimes.com and smartphone and tablet apps.  See the Times digital subscription page for details.Q. Do I have to wait to read Times articles in Factiva and LexisNexis?A. Times articles appear in Factiva and LexisNexis the same day they are published in the paper. Q. Is everything that's available on the nytimes.com site available in the library databases?A. Factiva and LexisNexis provide only the text of Times articles.  Times photos, videos, and multimedia are not available in these databases.  (Photos are included in ProQuest Digital Microfilm, but are not in color or of the same quality as the website.) Online-only articles from the Times website can be searched in Factiva , though they are not included in the browsable contents.Q. What about the print newspaper?  Do the Libraries still carry that?A. Yes.  Print copies of the New York Times are available every day in O'Neill Library, Bapst Library, and the Theology and Ministry Library.  O'Neill keeps print copies for one week.Q. Is this going to happen with other newspapers? If it does, will I have access to content from those papers, too?A. Everyone's going to be watching what happens with the Times, but many think it's inevitable that other newspapers will start charging for content. LexisNexis and Factiva carry many other major (and not so major) newspapers.  The database PressDisplay, available from the BC Libraries, offers the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and many other papers from around the world in full color, exactly as they appear in print, on the same day they are published. The database Massachusetts Newsstand has the Globe and other Massachusetts newspapers."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=298061&sid=3480602"}

Here are some key differences: E-books come in various file formats (see \"E-book Formats\" tab on this guide) and each e-reader/device accepts specific e-book formats (see grid showing options per reader/device).  There are software solutions that can help with converting one format into another that your reader/device can use.DRM, or Digital Rights ManagementPublishers usually require DRM restrictions be placed on their offerings to restrict free distribution.  DRM comes into play particularly when you want to borrow e-books for downloading from libraries using systems like OverDrive, and others.  DRM takes a variety of forms, but may include limits on copying/printing, transferring, multiple user access, etc.  E-book management systems, such as Adobe Digital Editions, \"applies\" DRM to titles that you want to borrow, in compliance with publisher agreements.  To learn more, see  DRM: a Teleread Primer.Public DomainThese are books (and other materials) that have been put out for free use.  Usually, these are older books that are now outside of copyright.  See the \"Finding Free E-books\" tab for resources that include freely-available titles.","Getting Ready to Read ******* E-books are everywhere.  If you haven't tried them, and are curious, here are some ways to begin:1.  Find e-books you want to readUse Holmes to find e-books in the Boston College Collections (search tips), or scan this guide for a sampling of e-book collections held at BC.  For pleasure reading try out our OverDrive collection. There are also many websites offering free access to e-books in the public domain.2.  Where will you be reading your e-books?  This may affect the e-book format you chooseOn your computer or laptopScholarly publishers overwhelmingly offer their e-books in PDF format (and/or, occasionally in HTML), making these easy to use on computers.    A very small number of these publishers are also starting to offer downloading in EPUB format, a fairly recent industry standard (the newer, EPUB3 standard with increased functionality, is under development).  Read EPUB on your computer using the free  Adobe Digital Editions software.  Other formats can be converted and managed on your computer using various software solutions or apps (see the E-book Formats tab). E-book Readers/DevicesDifferent reading devices accomodate different e-book formats.  In some cases, you'll be able to convert one e-book format into another for downloading onto your device.  See the grid displaying e-readers/ devices, and the e-book formats they support.  3.   Download e-book software that you may needFor e-books in formats other than PDF's/HTML, you will almost certainly need to download one of the major e-book software/management solutions:  Adobe Digital Editions, OverDrive Media Console, or Stanza Desktop (there is also a Stanza app for the IPhone/IPad).  For borrowing e-books using OverDrive, you may need either of the first two, depending upon the format you choose.  "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=324865&sid=2658827"}

Many users have already discovered OverDrive through their public libraries.  You'll find here many \"best-sellers\" listed in the New York Times, Boston Globe and other places, along with titles that others are talking about right now.  OverDrive also offers audio books;  at this time these are not included in the Boston College collection.  If you don't see what you are looking for and would like to suggest an OverDrive purchase, email lymanth@bc.edu with your suggestions.  Please note that BC's OverDrive subscription is available to current members of the Boston College community.While OverDrive is especially designed to deliver e-book content for downloading to e-book readers, tablets and other devices, you can also read these books on your computer/laptop.Here is a brief guide to getting started using OverDrive:Step 1:  Find what you want to read.On the Boston College OverDrive page, search for the book(s) you'd like to check out.  Look for the Quick Search box in the upper right.  You might want to use the check-box option to limit your search to those titles where copies are available for loan (not currently checked out).  For more search options click on Advanced Search or use the Browse options on the left of the screen.You can have two books checked out in OverDrive at one time at Boston College.Step 2:  Choose the format you need for the device you'll be using, and click \"Add to Cart\".(Once you have added an item to your cart you have 15 minutes to \"Proceed to Check Out\" before it is removed from your cart for others to check out.)Shown here are the format choices you'll see in OverDrive; suggested devices are listed just below.  Amazon offers free Kindle apps for a wide array of e-reading devices, so you don't have to have a Kindle to use this format.  Note: there are select publishers that require that the Kindle download be done via USB port (requiring a Kindle device); this will be noted just below the format icon. Both Adobe EPUB and Adobe PDF e-book formats can be used on many devices, as well. See OverDrive's Device Resource Center for more help in choosing the right format for your device. When ready for checkout, choose a loan period (7-, 14- or 21-days).

After checkout, you are free to download your e-book when you are ready (no immediate time limit).Step 3:  Make sure you have the software you need for the type of e-book you want to download.  If not, download the software needed:For the Kindle format (for use on Kindle or on other devices in combination with a free Kindle app), you'll need  to download the OverDrive Media Console software for your device.  Kindle format choice will take you into the Amazon page; choose \"Get Library Book\".  Login to your Amazon account and choose a delivery option. For the Adobe EPUB and PDF formats you'll need to download and install the free Adobe Digital Editions software.  Once installed, you will be able to download your new title into your Adobe Digital Editions library for reading on your computer or for transfer to a device.Step 4:  When you are finished with your e-book, you can return it early (this lets you to check out a new one under your 2-book limit)For Kindle books, go into Amazon and look for the Kindle link to find \"Manage Your Kindle\" to return and/or delete the item from your Kindle Library.For Adobe Digital Editions EPUBs and PDFs, within your ADE Library click on the small arrow to the left of the title, and choose from the dropdown menu that appears."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=324865&sid=2658833"}

{"guide_id":"354479","tags":{},"guide_name":"Assessing Journal Quality","guide_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/journalquality","page_name":"Criteria Used","page_id":"2899371","taxonomy":[],"page_text":["Impact Factor ******* A journal&rsquo;s Impact Factor (IF) is often used to judge the quality of a journal. One may use the database Journal Citation Reports (JCR) to assess the IF of roughly 11,000 Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) journals. The IF is the frequency with which articles from a journal published in the past two years have been cited in a particular year. ISI&rsquo;s IF is calculated by dividing the number of current year citations by the total number of articles published in the two previous years. An IF of 2.0 signifies that, on average, the articles published one or two years ago have been cited twice. Caution: one of the major question marks associated with IFs is that only a small number of journals have them, i.e. only those journals indexed by JCR (over 8,000 journals in Science and 2,700 in the Social Sciences).","Eigenfactor Score and Article Influence Score ******* Like the Impact Factor, the Eigenfactor\u00ae Score and Article Influence\u00ae Score use citation data to assess and track the influence of a journal in relation to other journals. The Eigenfactor Score calculation is based on the number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year, but it also considers which journals have contributed these citations so that highly cited journals will influence the network more than lesser cited journals. The Article Influence determines the average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years after publication.  It is calculated by dividing a journal&rsquo;s Eigenfactor Score by the number of articles in the journal, normalized as a fraction of all articles in all publications.  The mean Article Influence Score is 1.00. A score greater than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has above-average influence. A score less than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has below-average influence.","Editorial Board ******* The scholarly reputation of editorial board members may provide tips about the quality of the journal. However, this strategy is clearly open to strong elements of subjectivity.","Where Indexed ******* Where a journal is indexed may give a clue as to its quality. The database UlrichsWeb Global Serials Directory provides detailed indexing information on over 300,000 journals, both academic and popular.","Acceptance/Rejection Rates ******* Methods for determining acceptance/rejection rates may differ from journal to journal. Journal X may calculate the acceptance rate based on the number of articles accepted out of all articles submitted. Journal Y may calculate the rate from the number of articles accepted out of the articles sent out for peer review. Another factor is the disciplinary area. A subject area for which few scholars write articles may have a higher acceptance rate than other more popular subject areas. A strategy useful for determining acceptance/rejection rates in some subject areas, e.g business and education, is to consult Cabell&rsquo;s Directories of Publishing Opportunities.","Peer-Reviewed ******* A traditional criterion for evaluating the quality of a journal is to ascertain whether it is peer reviewed (refereed) or not. However, the challenge here is that often there is a very wide range of quality in peer reviewed journals. One may consult the database UlrichsWeb Global Serials Directory to determine if a journal is peer-reviewed.","Publication Fees ******* Many open access journals require authors to pay publication fees. This is not necessarily a red flag. Numerous quality OA journals, some very prestigious, have a system of &ldquo;author pays\". A particular problem, however, is the growth of \"fake\" journals whose sole goal is to obtain money from authors. A useful resource for determining some of these spurious journals is Jeffrey Beall's List of Predatory, Open-Access Publishers.","Publisher ******* A hint about journal quality may be provided by the society, association, organization publishing it.","Google Scholar Metrics ******* Google Scholar Metrics (GSM) allows one to gauge the visibility and influence of recent articles in scholarly journals. Particularly interesting is GSM&rsquo;s listing of the top 100 publications in several languages, ordered by their five-year h-index and h-median metrics. More details. ","Criteria for Assessing Journals ******* A question frequently asked is &ldquo;How can I tell if this journal is of good scholarly worth\". Evaluative criteria often used include those discussed in the other boxes on this page."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=354479&sid=2899371"}

Most notable amongst these acquisitions was the 2010 addition of a rare first edition of Newton's Principia (Philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica).  Other important works are also available for research, including:A third edition of the Principia.A first edition of Galileo's Istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari e loro accidenti :  comprese in tre lettere scritte all'illvstrissimo signor Marco Velseri ... /  dal signor Galileo Galilei ... ; si aggiungono nel fine le lettere, e disquisizioni del finto Apelle [Christoph Scheiner]. In Roma: Appresso Giacomo Mascardi, MDCXIII [1613]. This pioneering work on the subject of sun spots and inertia was a gift of Wega and Angelo Firenze, Belmont, MA, from the library of Wega's father, acclaimed physicist Pasquale Sconzo.A number of key scientific works by Copernicus, Clavius, Kircher, Scheiner.","Acquisition Highlights ******* Access to the older journal literature is critical for physicists.

Newspapers are periodicals. Why do librarians call them periodicals? It's our business to collect and provide access to all kinds of publications.

Newspapers and magazines are published daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthlyappeal to broad demographic groupssell 10,000-2,000,000 copiesNewspapers and magazines often fall under what librarians and publishers call \"popular\" publications.Journalsare published monthly, quarterly, or semi-annuallyappeal to narrow clusters of academics and researcherssell 500-5,000 copies, mostly to librariesJournals are also often called academic or scholarly to indicate both their origins (often in academic institutions) and audiences (often scholars). They are also often peer-reviewed or refereed.Students new to these terms often confuse journal with article. An article is a single authored item within any kind of periodical. A journal is a periodically-published collection of articles by different authors.","Peer-Reviewed or Refereed ******* Many academic journals are peer-reviewed or refereed journals. When an author (usually a university professor and/or researcher) submits an article, copies are sent to several reviewers who are expert scholars in the author's field. These reviewers then recommend whether or not the article should be published. Some journals reject as many as 90% of submissions. This rigrorous review process provides a high degree of credibility.Two short, informative videos about Scholarly and Peer-Reviewed journals: Peer Review in 5 MinutesWhat is a Scholarly Journal Article?

Periodicals ******* Blogs are such a new form that only 10 years ago, librarians were writing articles noting a minor new phenomenon called a \"weblog.\" Now, some blogs--especially authoritative ones--are beginning to be included in article databases. An especially good source for blogs is Lexis-Nexis:Blogs take many different forms, but most often would parallel Trade/Industry or Popular categories. However, a few blogs have begun to experiment with using modified forms of peer-review; it may not be long before there is a significant number of blogs that could be called Academic or Peer-Reviewed.Editorial review of blogs, however, is often different from the editorial review of periodicals. Blogs are not published periodically, nor do they all have large staffs of writers overseen by editors, like newspapers and magazines. Often, blogs are run by individuals or small teams of writers who make all decisions about content. Therefore, blogs often represent views of individuals or small groups, and even when authoritative may be more biased or partisan than other forms of writing.In some fields--especially fields where information changes very quickly, like social media or technology industries--certain blogs are the most authoritative source of current information. Scholars sometimes maintain blogs as platforms for educating the public about current research in an area, and sometimes as conduits for communicating with other researchers or practitioners. Eavesdropping on blogs by scholars (and blog comments) can give you a glimpse into the world of back-room academic conversations. Look out! It can get rough sometimes.Use blogs as sources, but use them with caution. Check with your instructor: he or she may be aware of certain blogs that are highly regarded in the field. He or she may also simply rule out blogs as sources, since the task of evaluating their authoritativeness and bias may be beyond the scope of the course.","Searching for Authoritative Blogs ******* It can be difficult to locate authoritative blogs.

Libraries provide a way to limit search results to peer-reviewed publications*. Look for a checkbox or drop-down menu item that says one of the following:AcademicPeer-ReviewedRefereed  *Caution! Just because you limit your search to results from peer-reviewed journals does not mean that all articles in the search will have been peer-reviewed. Academic journals include many types of writing (e.g., editorials, reviews, letters, etc.) that are not peer-reviewed, and will likely appear in search results. When in doubt, check with your instructor.","Confirming: is it Peer-Reviewed? ******* If the database you are using does not have a peer-review/academic checkbox, you can use Ulrich's Periodicals Directory to find out whether the journal is peer-reviewed. Just type the periodical title into the search box, and then find the entry for that title in the search results. If you see the icon of the referee jersey to the left of the title (  ), the journal publishes peer-reviewed articles.Caution! Just because a journal publishes peer-reviewed articles doesn't mean that everything in the journal is peer-reviewed. Editorials, letters, book reviews, and some other types of writing are rarely peer-reviewed. When in doubt, check with your instructor.","How Authoritative is the Periodical? ******* A journal&rsquo;s Impact Factor (IF)--a measure of how frequently articles in a journal are cited by other writers*--is often used to judge the quality of a journal. Use Journal Citation Reports (JCR) to assess the IF of over 12,000 Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) journals. The Web of Science also uses the ISI database of citations, and allows you both to compare citations of articles and click hyperlinked citing articles, or even find similar articles based on citation patterns.Other measures of impact:Google Scholar Metrics (h-index, h-median)Eigenfactor\u00ae Score and Article Influence\u00ae ScoreCautions: One of the major concerns associated with these measures is that only a small number of journals have them, i.e. only those journals indexed by JCR (over 8,000 journals in Science and 2,700 in the Social Sciences). Also, certain fields and journal types will necessarily have smaller IF's, simply because those fields are either narrow or don't cite as heavily. A high-profile periodical like Nature has a very high IF partly because it has broad distribution, covers many areas in science, and is in a field that values citation highly. Some humanities and social science journals are very important but have narrower distribution, cover narrow areas, and participate in fields that don't cite as heavily. When comparing journal IF's, compare only within fields, not across fields.-------------*Formula:  ISI&rsquo;s IF is calculated by dividing the number of current year citations by the total number of articles published in the two previous years. An IF of 2.0 signifies that, on average, the articles published up to two years ago have been cited twice. "],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=399341&sid=3325181"}

Articles in academic journals are usually lengthy, of interest principally to researchers in a narrowly defined field, and full of jargon used by researchers in that field.ArticleA piece of writing shorter than a book-length work that can vary in length from a few to 100 pages. An article is always subsidiary to a larger body of work: e.g., a journal, a book, a website.DatabaseA resource for storing vast quantities of organized information. In a library context, it usually means a database of information about articles, with an interface designed for searching by keyword, subject, title, author, and other categories. Databases of this type are usually specific to a field, like Biosys or PsycInfo, but there are also a few multidisciplinary databases, such as Academic OneFile.IssueThe number for a particular journal publication within a volume. A volume usually consists of one entire year, while an issue usually refers to one single publication. Unlike magazines, whose issues are usually identified by a date, academic journals are usually identified by volume and issue. These numbers are sometimes identified explicitly--e.g., \"Volume 42, Issue 3\"--and sometimes typographically--e.g. \"42 (3)\". Sometimes, two issues are condensed into one publication date--e.g., \"Volume 42, Issue 2/3\" or 42 (2,3)\". These numbers are important for locating a particular journal issue that contains an article. You may need to keep track of these numbers when the \"Find it\" button takes you to a journal website rather than directly to an article.JournalUsually, an academic periodical, often published quarterly. A \"journal\" is basically the academic equivalent of a \"magazine.\" Academics use a different word because of substantial differences in purpose, appearance, and audience. Academic journals are generally smaller and thicker, have few ads and little color, serve a narrow audience of a few thousand scholars by providing informative articles, and are non-profit in editorial intent, even when published by for-profit companies.MagazineA popular periodical, usually published weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, on glossy paper; of course, most magazines also make content available online; usually, the online version follows the layout and design constraints of the print version. The purpose of most magazines is to make money for their owners by increasing market share and advertising revenue. Articles in magazines therefore try to appeal to the broadest possible audience within a target demographic. Magazines are colorful and full of attractive images and advertisements for retail products. Article purposes are about equally divided between informing and entertaining. Trustworthiness of information varies widely.NewspaperA popular periodical, usually published daily or weekly, on large format newsprint. The purpose of most newspapers is to make money for its owners by increasing market share for its advertisers. Some newspapers increase market share by appealing to customer values of trustworthiness and objectivity. Often, though, newspapers appeal to customers' political or social values and are therefore biased. Trustworthiness of reporting varies widely.Peer-ReviewA system of editorial control for encouraging accuracy and trustworthiness in academic publication. The process is designed to be as objective as possible: usually, three or more outside experts are engaged to review a manuscript submitted to a journal. They are unpaid volunteers unaffiliated with the publication. If the process is \"blind,\" their identities are concealed from the author, and the author's identity from them. They can recommend publication, publication after revision, re-submission after revision, or they can outright reject publication. They often provide detailed comments for revision.PeriodicalAny publication that is issued on a periodic (daily, weekly, monthly, annually) basis.Popular PeriodicalThe library term for publications that are intended to appeal to broad audiences, such as magazines and newspapers.RefereedScholarly or academic journals whose articles are peer-reviewed in some fashion. \"Refereed\" is generally understood to be a broader term that encompasses other types of review, such as careful editorial review.Scholarly PeriodicalSee \"Academic Journal\"Trade/Industry PeriodicalA periodical intended to inform industry practitioners and professionals about new and/or interesting products, processes, business developments, people, and other news related to a particular industry. The format resembles a magazine, but the content is so specific to a particular industry or set of products that nobody would confuse this for a popular publication.VolumeUsually, one year of a journal's publication run. A volume may contain any number of issues, usually between 4 and 12. Though a volume usually corresponds to a year, it may correspond to an academic year rather than a calendar year. That is, \"Volume 42\" could correspond to 2010, or it could correspond to the academic fiscal year July 2009 to June 2010. See \"Issue\" for typographic representations."],"page_url":"http://libguides.bc.edu/content.php?pid=399341&sid=3327551"}

(Insert your first reference here)    There is very strong evidence that many students enjoy the combination of fun and scholarship.  To respond to this need, colleges and universities continue to spend millions of dollars to support the use of games in the learning process.  (Insert 2nd reference)   The No-Brain Foundation, a non-profit organization, recently donated Eighty Million dollars to the top 10 universities using games as part of their curriculum.  (Insert 3rd reference)Just last week, the Bank North Garden hosted the largest gaming night in Boston. In attendance were students of all ages, presidents of universities, as well as curious and confused parents.  Before the floor opened for action, Dr. Gameson of the University of Sega Dreamcast introduced some statistical facts about college students and gaming:32% of student gamers admitted playing games on cell phones, hand-held devices or laptops during class. (Insert 4th reference)66% felt that gaming had no influence on their academic performance, but 48% agreed that gaming keeps them from studying &ldquo;some&rdquo; or &ldquo;a lot.&rdquo;9% said that their primary motivation for playing games was to avoid studying.62% reported that they study for classes no more than 7 hours a week, and 15% reported studying 12 hours or more a week. (Insert 5th reference)In the middle of Dr. Gameson&rsquo;s statistical litany, there was uproar in the breeches of the Bank North Garden.  Apparently, Mrs. Atari, whose son&rsquo;s tuition and other expenses total over fifty thousand US. Dollars became unconscious after hearing how students spend their time on gaming. In his usual lackadaisical manner, young Atari fixated to his game on his G3 I-Phone said without even making eye contact with anyone: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my Mom&mdash;she makes a scene out of everything.  (Insert 6th reference)  She wants attention.&rdquo; No indeed, his Mom had fainted.  Luckily, Nowell GameCube, young Atari&rsquo;s roommate remembered how to perform CPR on his friend&rsquo;s Mom&mdash;skills he had learned from playing his latest videogame called Mama-Resuscitator.

(Insert your first reference here)    There is very strong evidence that many students enjoy the combination of fun and scholarship.  To respond to this need, colleges and universities continue to spend millions of dollars to support the use of games in the learning process.  (Insert 2nd reference)   The No-Brain Foundation, a non-profit organization, recently donated Eighty Million dollars to the top 10 universities using games as part of their curriculum.  (Insert 3rd reference)Just last week, the Bank North Garden hosted the largest gaming night in Boston. In attendance were students of all ages, presidents of universities, as well as curious and confused parents.  Before the floor opened for action, Dr. Gameson of the University of Sega Dreamcast introduced some statistical facts about college students and gaming:32% of student gamers admitted playing games on cell phones, hand-held devices or laptops during class. (Insert 4th reference)66% felt that gaming had no influence on their academic performance, but 48% agreed that gaming keeps them from studying &ldquo;some&rdquo; or &ldquo;a lot.&rdquo;9% said that their primary motivation for playing games was to avoid studying.62% reported that they study for classes no more than 7 hours a week, and 15% reported studying 12 hours or more a week. (Insert 5th reference)In the middle of Dr. Gameson&rsquo;s statistical litany, there was uproar in the breeches of the Bank North Garden.  Apparently, Mrs. Atari, whose son&rsquo;s tuition and other expenses total over fifty thousand US. Dollars became unconscious after hearing how students spend their time on gaming. In his usual lackadaisical manner, young Atari fixated to his game on his G3 I-Phone said without even making eye contact with anyone: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my Mom&mdash;she makes a scene out of everything.  (Insert 6th reference)  She wants attention.&rdquo; No indeed, his Mom had fainted.  Luckily, Nowell GameCube, young Atari&rsquo;s roommate remembered how to perform CPR on his friend&rsquo;s Mom&mdash;skills he had learned from playing his latest videogame called Mama-Resuscitator.

Can the Libraries get a Times digital subscription that we can use?A. No. The Times does not offer multi-user subscriptions for libraries and their patrons. However, through an arrangement with Quality of Student Life Committee (QSLC), Boston College faculty, students and administrators are eligible to receive a 50 percent discount off individual subscriptions via nytimes.com and smartphones.  (Go to NYTimes.com/CollegeDS  and follow the directions there.)Q. Does that mean I can't access any of the Times content on their site or on my smartphone or iPad without an individual subscription?A. The Times allows users to access up to 10 articles on its website per month with no cost. The Top News section will remain free on smartphone and tablet apps. Beyond that, digital subscriptions are required.  Subscribers to the print newspaper get free access via nytimes.com and smartphone and tablet apps.  See the Times digital subscription page for details.Q. Do I have to wait to read Times articles in Factiva and LexisNexis?A. Times articles appear in Factiva and LexisNexis the same day they are published in the paper. Q. Is everything that's available on the nytimes.com site available in the library databases?A. Factiva and LexisNexis provide only the text of Times articles.  Times photos, videos, and multimedia are not available in these databases.  (Photos are included in ProQuest Digital Microfilm, but are not in color or of the same quality as the website.) Online-only articles from the Times website can be searched in Factiva , though they are not included in the browsable contents.Q. What about the print newspaper?  Do the Libraries still carry that?A. Yes.  Print copies of the New York Times are available every day in O'Neill Library, Bapst Library, and the Theology and Ministry Library.  O'Neill keeps print copies for one week.Q. Is this going to happen with other newspapers? If it does, will I have access to content from those papers, too?A. Everyone's going to be watching what happens with the Times, but many think it's inevitable that other newspapers will start charging for content. LexisNexis and Factiva carry many other major (and not so major) newspapers.  The database PressDisplay, available from the BC Libraries, offers the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and many other papers from around the world in full color, exactly as they appear in print, on the same day they are published. The database Massachusetts Newsstand has the Globe and other Massachusetts newspapers.","Browse Today's New York Times in Factiva ******* To browse the New York Times from Factiva's front page, go to News Pages and scroll down past the Wall Street Journal to the Times.
